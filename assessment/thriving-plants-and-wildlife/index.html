    The summary Figure shows the proportion of indicator components for which ‘Thriving plants and wildlife’ is the primary goal that have been assigned to each assessment category, with the exact number of indicator components shown as a label on the bars.

</br></br>There are 15 indicators comprising of 33 indicator components in total with this primary goal. Some components were not assessed as they do not present results as a time series (C2i Seabed subject to high pressure from human activity; the 4 indicator components recorded under C4 Regional sea assessments and the status of coastal water bodies and offshore units for 4 UK seafloor habitats; C5a Changes in plankton communities; C5b Changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance; the 2 indicator components for C6 Diverse seas: status of threatened and declining features; the 2 indicator components for C7a Typical Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities; the 2 indicator components for C7b Mean Maximum Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities; C8 Healthy seas: marine food webs functioning; C9 Seafloor habitats functioning; D1 Quantity, quality and connectivity of habitats; and D5 Conservation status of our native species).

</br></br>Of the remaining 16 indicator components assessed, 5 showed an improvement, 5 showed little or no change and 6 showed a deterioration over the short term; 6 showed an improvement, 4 showed little or no change and 6 showed a deterioration over the medium term; and 7 showed and improvement and 9 showed a deterioration over the long term.
