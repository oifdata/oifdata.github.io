  <section class="l-column l-column--small-space">
    The summary Figure shows the proportion of indicator components for which ‘Using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently’ is the primary goal that have been assigned to each assessment category, with the exact number of indicator components shown as a label on the bars.

</br>Four indicators are classed as ‘not assessed’ in the figure because they are still in development (the 2 components of C11 status of sensitive fish and shellfish stocks, E7 healthy soils and E9 percentage of our seafood coming from healthy ecosystems, produced sustainably).

</br>It is not possible to simply define any change in the 4 agriculture related indicators (E1 to E4) as an ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’ as this will depend on whether the specific farming practices driving change are positive for the environment and there will be inherent trade-offs of impact to account for. Similarly, it is not possible to simply define any change in the biomass component of indicator J2a Raw material consumption as an ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’ because there is no desired direction of change. The assessment results for these indicators are therefore not included in the summary figure. However, it is possible to state the direction of change in the summary table. The volume of agricultural production has increased in the short, medium and long term, whereas there has been little or no change in the volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the short and medium term and a decrease in the long term. There has been a decrease in biomass consumption across all 3 assessment periods.

</br>Of the remaining 9 indicator components, 5 showed an improvement and 4 showed a deterioration over the short-term assessment period, and 7 showed an improvement and 2 showed little or no change over the medium term. Two indicators (E5 and E6) did not have sufficiently long time series available for a long-term assessment, but the remaining 7 indicator components showed an improvement over this period.
