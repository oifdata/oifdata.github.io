"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,"Ozone is a gas which is damaging to human health and can trigger inflammation of the respiratory tract, eyes, nose and throat as well as asthma attacks. "
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",A5 Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,Short-term exposure to concentrations of NO2 can cause inflammation of the airways and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and to allergens. NO2 can exacerbate the symptoms of those already suffering from lung or heart conditions. 
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,G1 Changes in landscape and waterscape character,Negative,"Nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses. "
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",B2 Serious pollution incidents to water,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,"The 2 higher categories of serious pollution event cause, for example, potential harm to bathers."
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",B4 Condition of bathing waters,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Positive,"Status of bathing waters is based on a set of microbiological tests (measuring E.coli and intestinal enterococci) performed on waters used for bathing. The bacteria, if present, can cause severe stomach upsets and gastro-intestinal illness."
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment","D2 Extent and condition of protected sites – land, water and sea",G1 Changes in landscape and waterscape character,Positive,Changes in environmental outcomes from our Designated Landscapes will be considered as part of the G1 indicator. 
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",D3 Area of woodland in England ,G1 Changes in landscape and waterscape character,Positive,G1 will consider attributes of landscape such as woodland cover.
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",D3 Area of woodland in England ,G3 Enhancement of green/blue infrastructure,Positive,Woodland will be included in metrics of green infrastructure.
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",D3 Area of woodland in England ,G4 Engagement in the natural environment,Positive,Some visits to the natural environment will be visits to woodland.
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",H3 Emissions of mercury and persistent organic pollutants to the environment,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,"POPs are chemicals that remain intact in the environment for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the tissues of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health or on the environment.

"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",H5 Exposure to transport noise,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,"Health costs (and hence burden to the economy) of noise can be estimated from health outcomes associated with noise exposure (such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular effects)."
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",J5 Prevent harmful chemicals from being recycled,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Positive,Chemicals measured in J5 include POPs which can bioaccumulate and have harmful impacts on health.
"Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment",J6 Waste crime,G1 Changes in landscape and waterscape character,Negative,"Fly tipping will influence changes in the public’s perceptions of landscape character and quality, which will become part of the G1 indicator."
