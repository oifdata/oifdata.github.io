From Indicator,To Indicator,Correlation,Rationale
A1 Emissions for five key air pollutants,A3 Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air,Positive,"A1 includes emissions of PM2.5. As well as being emitted directly, particulate matter can be formed in the atmosphere from reactions between other pollutants, of which SO2, NOx, NMVOCs and NH3 are the most important."
A1 Emissions for five key air pollutants,A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,Positive,Damaging nutrient nitrogen comes predominantly from ammonia (NH3) but partly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and long-range transport of air pollutants.
A1 Emissions for five key air pollutants,A7 Area exposed to damaging levels of ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere,Positive,A1 includes emissions of NH3
A1 Emissions for five key air pollutants,A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),Positive,A1 includes NOx and VOC emissions. Chemical reactions in the air involving NOX and VOCs produce the toxic gas O3.
A1 Emissions for five key air pollutants,A5 Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations,Positive,NOx emissions (A1) include NO2 so contributes to roadside concentrations.
A3 Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) in the air,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,B3 State of the water environment,Negative,Nutrients are a major cause of water bodies being at less than good ecological status and also affect drinking water quality. Nitrates account for 65% of the reasons for failure for those groundwaters that are protected for use for drinking water and are classed at poor status. Nitrate enters groundwater from diffuse pollution on land (mainly water run-off from agricultural land) or is deposited onto land from the air.
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,"D1 Quantity, quality and connectivity of habitats",Negative,"Nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses."
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,D4 Relative abundance and distribution of widespread species,Negative,"Nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses."
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,D5 Conservation status of our native species,Negative,"Nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses."
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,D6 Abundance and distribution of priority species in England,Negative,"Nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses."
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,E7 Healthy soils,Negative,Excess deposition of NH3 on natural ecosystems causes nutrient enrichment and changes in vegetation and soils.
A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,G1 Changes in landscape and waterscape character,Negative,"Nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses."
A7 Area exposed to damaging levels of ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere,A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,Positive,"NH3 emissions can be deposited in soils or in rivers and lakes, for example, through rain. Resulting nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses."
A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,"Ozone is a gas which is damaging to human health and can trigger inflammation of the respiratory tract, eyes, nose and throat as well as asthma attacks."
A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),"D1 Quantity, quality and connectivity of habitats",Negative,Ozone can have adverse effects on the environment through oxidative damage to vegetation.
A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),D5 Conservation status of our native species,Negative,Ozone can have adverse effects on the environment through oxidative damage to vegetation.
A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),E2 Volume of agricultural production,Negative,Ozone can have adverse effects on the environment through oxidative damage to vegetation including crops.
A5 Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations,G7 Health and wellbeing benefits,Negative,Short-term exposure to concentrations of NO2 can cause inflammation of the airways and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections and to allergens. NO2 can exacerbate the symptoms of those already suffering from lung or heart conditions.
A5 Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations,A4 Rural background concentrations of ozone (O3),Positive,NO2 is one of the precursors to O3.
E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production,A1 Emissions for five key air pollutants,Positive,"Agricultural sources make up by far the largest component in the inventory for ammonia emissions with cattle manure management, manure applied to soils and inorganic fertilizers each accounting for 20% or more of the emissions from this sector. Agriculture also contributes a small proportion to NMVOC and PM2.5 emissions."
E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production,A6 Exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems,Positive,"Agricultural sources make up by far the largest component in the inventory for ammonia emissions with cattle manure management, manure applied to soils and inorganic fertilizers each accounting for 20% or more of the emissions from this sector."
