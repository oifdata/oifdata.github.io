<h2 id="what-is-the-25-year-environment-plan%3F" tabindex="-1">What is the 25 Year Environment Plan? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-25-year-environment-plan%3F"></a></h2>
<p>The government published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">A Green Future: Our 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment</a> in January 2018. It sets out 10 goals for improving the environment in England. A commitment was also made to develop a comprehensive set of indicators to measure environmental change.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-outcome-indicator-framework%3F" tabindex="-1">What is the Outcome Indicator Framework? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-outcome-indicator-framework%3F"></a></h2>
<p>The Outcome Indicator Framework report: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/25-year-environment-plan">Measuring environmental change: Outcome Indicator Framework for the 25 Year Environment Plan</a>, was published in May 2019. Drawing on advice from a wide range of experts and stakeholders, it presented 66 indicators to give a comprehensive view of the environment and how it is changing. The 2019 report set out in detail the purpose of the Outcome Indicator Framework and examples of how the indicators can be used.</p>
<p>The Outcome Indicator Framework has an important role in our longer-term understanding of the effectiveness of policies and interventions. The indicators are a systematic means of monitoring environmental change, recognising that complex natural and social systems will respond to change on a range of timescales.</p>
<p>The Outcome Indicator Framework will:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable clear communication of important environmental trends in England</li>
<li>provide a set of indicators which relate to all aspects of the environment and all goals within the 25 Year Environment Plan</li>
<li>communicate data which gives a high-level picture of the environment and how it is changing – more extensive data and indicators may additionally be available from other sources</li>
<li>be used for assessment of changes in the natural environment, for example against the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan, or in applying a natural capital approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-the-environmental-improvement-plan-2023%3F" tabindex="-1">What is the Environmental Improvement Plan 2023? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-environmental-improvement-plan-2023%3F"></a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environmental-improvement-plan">Environmental Improvement Plan 2023</a> is the first revision of the 25 Year Environment Plan. It builds on the 25 Year Environment Plan vision with a new plan setting out how the government will work with landowners, communities and businesses to deliver each of its goals for improving the environment, matched with interim targets to measure progress. Taking these actions will help us restore nature, reduce environmental pollution, and increase the prosperity of our country.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-outcome-indicator-framework-be-reviewed-following-publication-of-the-environmental-improvement-plan-2023%3F" tabindex="-1">Will the Outcome Indicator Framework be reviewed following publication of the Environmental Improvement Plan 2023? <a class="header-anchor" href="#will-the-outcome-indicator-framework-be-reviewed-following-publication-of-the-environmental-improvement-plan-2023%3F"></a></h2>
<p>The Outcome Indicator Framework will undergo a review in 2024 to evaluate its ongoing suitability and consideration of best available evidence. This review will also consider the framework’s alignment with the updated policy landscape of the Environmental Improvement Plan 2023.</p>
<p>Current references to the 25 Year Environment Plan are maintained in advance of this review.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-natural-capital-approach%3F" tabindex="-1">What is a natural capital approach? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-natural-capital-approach%3F"></a></h2>
<p>Natural capital is defined as the ‘elements of the environment which provide valuable goods and services to people such as clean air, clean water, food and recreation’. A natural capital approach is advocated by the 25 Year Environment Plan as it accounts for all the different ways the environment benefits society and so can inform better decision making and the concept of natural capital was used to develop the Outcome Indicator Framework. A natural capital approach sets out the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce pressures on natural capital (for example, pollution or plant disease)</li>
<li>improve the state of natural assets (including air, water, land and seas)</li>
<li>increase the benefits that we get from those assets</li>
</ul>
<p>The 66 outcome indicators can be considered as either a measure of (a) the pressure on natural capital assets, (b) the extent/condition of natural capital assets or (c) the service or benefit associated with natural capital assets. This classification is not always straightforward since the condition of one natural capital asset (for example, air quality) may place a pressure on another (for example, wildlife habitat). It is important to recognise that multiple interactions occur across the indicators and categories. By classifying these indicators in this way, we can also show which direction of change in the indicator reflects an improvement to environment (that is, a downward trend for pressures and an upward trend for the condition of an asset or the provision of a benefit).</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-reporting-status-mean%3F" tabindex="-1">What does the reporting status mean? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-the-reporting-status-mean%3F"></a></h2>
<p>We have used 3 categories of reporting status for the indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final – no further significant development of the indicator is immediately expected, notwithstanding the future development of the framework as a whole.</li>
<li>Interim – further development is necessary for the indicator to be complete; for example, England-level data may need to be extracted from a UK wide dataset, additional data may need to be added to the indicator, or the methods used for deriving an indicator are expected to be further developed.</li>
<li>In development – the indicator is not currently available to report; further research is required and/or ongoing to determine the most suitable data and methods for analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-outcome-indicator-framework-an-official-or-national-statistics-publication%3F" tabindex="-1">Is the Outcome Indicator Framework an official or National Statistics publication? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-the-outcome-indicator-framework-an-official-or-national-statistics-publication%3F"></a></h2>
<p>Although the report and this dashboard are not classified as official statistics or a National Statistic compendium publication, where possible we follow the UK’s <a href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/">Code of Practice for Statistics</a> in its production and in the compilation of the indicator framework within it. The <a href="/official-statistics/">Official statistics</a> section of this website explains how we have demonstrated voluntary compliance with many parts of the Code, in line with the <a href="https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/how-to-apply-the-code-voluntarily/guide-to-voluntary-application-of-the-code/">Guide for Voluntary Application of the Code</a>.</p>

<p>The technologies for monitoring and assessing change in the environment are advancing rapidly and offer new cost-effective methods (for example, Earth observations, DNA methods, citizen science/mobile apps and new sensor technologies). We will look to update indicators to reflect these developments when appropriate but will ensure the environmental parameters used for reporting indicators are consistent and so retain the trend time-series.</p>
