For the percentage of landings from sustainably managed fisheries, refer to the upper graph. For total landings of quota fish and shellfish by sustainability status, refer to the lower graph.\n\n</br>Sustainable fisheries landings are those from fish stocks that either have a high spawning stock biomass (greater than or equal to MSY Btrigger) and are fished at or below the level capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (FMSY), or have a high spawning stock biomass and are fished within a range consistent with internationally agreed management plans (up to FMSY upper). Unsustainable fisheries landings are those from fish stocks that either have a low spawning stock biomass (less than MSY Btrigger) or from fish stocks that are fished above limits (that is, FMSY or FMSY upper where applicable).
