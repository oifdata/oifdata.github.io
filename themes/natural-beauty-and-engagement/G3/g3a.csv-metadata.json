The combined greenspace category, while not an officially designated greenspace standard in itself, includes the percentage of the population living within the defined proximity of access to any one or more of the doorstep greenspace, and local and neighbourhood natural greenspace standards outlined above. \n\n</br>The ‘percentage of total population covered by greenspace buffer’ is based on an assumption that the population within each [lower layer super output area](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography#super-output-area-soa) (LSOA) is evenly distributed.",
