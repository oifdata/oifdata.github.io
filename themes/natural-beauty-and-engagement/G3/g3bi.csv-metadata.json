Base: All respondents.\n    \n</br>The indicator is based on responses to question [M1_Q4]: ‘How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements relating to green and natural spaces generally? In general, green and natural spaces should be:’ and question [M1_Q5]: ‘Now, thinking about green and natural spaces close to where you live, how much do you agree or disagree with the following statements? My local green and natural spaces actually are:’. The statements presented to respondents are:</br> \n \n* a) within easy walking distance \n* b) good places for mental health and wellbeing \n* c) a high enough standard to want to spend time in \n* d) good places for children to play \n* e) places that encourage physical health and exercise \n* f) good places to meet other people \n* g) provide good opportunities to see nature \n    \n</br>Scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) are attributed to all responses to each of the statements relating to general expectations about green and natural spaces (question [M1_Q4]) and perceptions of the quality of local green and natural spaces (question [M1_Q5]). Overall means of all responses to the 7 statements are then presented as the annual indicator values for both expectations and perceptions. These values can range from 1, indicating the lowest levels of expectation and perception of the quality of green and natural spaces (equivalent to strongly disagreeing with all 7 statements) to 5, indicating the highest levels of expectation and perception (strongly agreeing with all 7 statements).",
