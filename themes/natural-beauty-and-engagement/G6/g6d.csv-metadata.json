Data are collected at 2 time-periods each year, across 2 to 3 weeks in the school holidays (August) and again during term-time (September to October). Base: All respondents.\n    \n</br>The indicator is based on responses to question [CS_Q10]: ‘Which of the following things do you do to look after the environment? There are lots of options but they may not all apply to you or all make sense. Only pick the ones you understand and do yourself to look after the environment.’ Scores from 0 (low pro-environmental behaviour) to 100 (high pro-environmental behaviour) represent an index of self-reported social action formed from the following statements:</br>\n    \n* ‘Eat less meat (including vegetarian or vegan)’\n* 'Turn lights off’\n* ‘Turn the tap off while brush my teeth’\n* ‘Think about the environment when I buy things’\n* ‘Recycle my waste’\n* ‘Do things in the garden to help the wildlife (for example, feed birds, grow plants that insects like, make homes for wildlife)’\n* ‘Pick up litter’\n* ‘Walk, cycle or take public transport as much as I can’\n* ‘Read about (online or in books) or watch programmes about the environment’",
