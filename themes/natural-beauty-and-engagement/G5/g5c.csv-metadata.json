Data are collected at 2 time-points each year, across 2 to 3 weeks in the school holidays (August) and again during term-time (September to October). Base: All respondents.\n    \n</br>The indicator is based on responses to question [CS_Q10]: ‘Which of the following things do you do to look after the environment? There are lots of options but they may not all apply to you or all make sense. Only pick the ones you understand and do yourself to look after the environment.’ Scores from 0 (low social action) to 100 (high social action) represent an index of self-reported social action formed from the following statements:\n    \n* ‘Talk to friends and family about looking after the environment’\n* ‘Volunteer my time (for example, litter pick, planting, raising awareness)’\n* ‘Raise awareness by posting or sharing information online’\n* ‘Try and change what our leaders are doing (for example, sign petitions, demonstrate, or write to them)’",
