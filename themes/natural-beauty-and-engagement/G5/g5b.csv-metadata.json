Base: All asked Module 4.\n    \n</br>The indicator is based on responses to question [M4_Q9, options b to h]: ‘How often do you do the actions below when you have the opportunity?’. Scores from 0 (low social action) to 100 (high social action) represent a weighted index of self-reported social action formed from the following statements:\n\n* ‘I vote for political parties with strong environmental policies’ \n* ‘I contact an MP or council about an environmental issue’ \n* ‘I sign petitions or participate in a campaign or demonstration about an environmental issue’ \n* ‘I volunteer time for an environmental cause’ \n* ‘I donate money to or am a member of an environmental organisation’\n* ‘I try to persuade people I know in person to do more to help the environment’ \n* ‘I post online content related to the environment’\n    \n</br>The inverse of the mean and the variance of responses on the 5-point rating scale (from 1-Never to 5-Always or whenever I have the opportunity) was used to determine an additional weighting by statement. By applying this weighting based on commonality, behaviours that require more commitment and are engaged with less frequently carry a higher weight in the overall index.",
