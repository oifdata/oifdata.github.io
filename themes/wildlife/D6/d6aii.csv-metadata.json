This release covers two measures of species abundance in England; the first which contains species for which we have suitable data (all-species), the second for only those species which appear on the priority species list for England. When fully developed, the all-species abundance measure will be used to track the government’s progress towards meeting the statutory target of halting the decline in species abundance by 2030, and then reversing these declines by 2042.</p>\n\n<p>Both indicators have been compiled by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), in conjunction with data providers from well-established volunteer-based recording schemes, many of which are run through partnerships between government bodies, NGOs and research organisations, or through statutory monitoring schemes.</p>\n\n<p>As this is an official statistic in development, we welcome feedback on the novel methods used in the development of this indicator and the presentation of the data. To give feedback, email the Environmental Statistics and Reporting team at <a href=\"mailto:enviro.statistics@defra.gov.uk\" class=\"govuk-link\">enviro.statistics@defra.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n</div>",
