    "notes": "The Red List Index for England includes 8,259 taxa across 23 major taxonomic groups. The 'Aggregate' category includes the results for all these taxa.\n    \nA comparison of Great Britain and England Red List categories across 4 taxonomic groups showed that between 80 to 92% of statuses align and therefore the Red List Index presented here is considered a good approximation of extinction risk in England. However, Great Britain scale assessments could still underestimate or overestimate extinction risk at an England scale and, importantly, losses from England of species still present in Scotland or Wales will not be detected by the index. \n    \nCaution is needed when comparing Red List Index values, or percentage threatened, across taxonomic groups for a number of reasons:\n    \n1. Data-rich groups may have a tendency towards elevated extinction risk because each taxon qualifies under relatively more assessment criteria than data-poor groups, and the highest qualifying threat category is assigned.\n2. Groups that contain higher proportions of infraspecific taxa can potentially introduce Red List Index bias because each species is effectively represented in the index multiple times.\n3. Groups that support higher proportions of Data Deficient taxa may result in Red List index values that underestimate the group's true extinction risk.\n4. Species loss in the Red List Index may be underestimated because of the use of inconsistent cut-off dates for extinction in Great Britain Red Lists.",
