    "notes": "Results are based on Great Britain Red List assessments of species known to be native to England.\n\n</br>The Red List Index for England includes 8,259 taxa across 23 major taxonomic groups. The 'Aggregate' category includes the results for all these taxa.\n\n</br>A comparison of Great Britain and England Red List categories across 4 taxonomic groups showed that between 80% to 92% of statuses aligned and therefore the Red List Index presented here is considered a good approximation of extinction risk in England. However, Great Britain scale assessments can underestimate or overestimate extinction risk at an England scale and, importantly, losses from England of species still present in Scotland or Wales will not be detected by the index. \n    \n</br>Care should be taken when comparing Red List Index values across groups because of differences in ‘red-listing’ that can result from data availability, taxonomic rank, and extinction definitions.",
