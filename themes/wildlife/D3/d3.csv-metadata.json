    "notes": "Annual datapoints reflect the area of conifer and broadleaf woodland in England at 31 March each year. \n    \n</br>Due to rounding, areas of conifer and broadleaf woodland shown here may not sum exactly to the total area of woodland in England shown in this indicator and in the source publication (Forest Research’s Forestry Statistics).\n\n</br>Data for 2021 to 2023 were revised in the 2025 update of this indicator. The total area of woodland reported has marginally increased for the 2022 and 2023 data points, mainly driven by a marginal increase in areas of broadleaf woodland. \n\n</br>There is a general assumption that woodlands that have been clearfelled will be restocked. These areas are classified as ‘woodlands in transition’ until there is evidence (through satellite imagery or aerial photography) that the areas have been replanted, have regenerated, or lost to another land use. As natural regeneration can take some time to establish, some areas can remain as woodlands in transition for more than 10 years and there can be considerable time lags between the felling of woodland to create open habitats and the designation of that area as non-woodland. It is likely this leads to some overestimation of the area of conifer woodland.\n\n</br>The area of woodland statistics are based on annual updates to both the NFI woodland map based on remote sensing and also administrative data on new planting of woodland. The split between conifer and broadleaf in the woodland map data is based on more accurate assessments of stocked areas from fieldwork data.",
