The types of waste fly-tipped range from ‘black bag’ waste to large deposits of materials such as industrial waste, tyres, construction material and liquid waste. Fly-tipping is a significant blight on local environments; a source of pollution; a potential danger to public health and hazard to wildlife. It also undermines legitimate waste businesses where unscrupulous operators undercut those operating within the law.</p>\n\n<p>Local councils and the Environment Agency (EA) both have a responsibility in respect of illegally deposited waste. Local councils deal with most cases of fly tipping on public land, whilst the EA investigates and enforces against the larger, more serious and organised illegal waste crimes.</p>\n\n<p>The associated data is available in CSV format and can be found here: <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/1388104c-3599-4cd2-abb5-ca8ddeeb4c9c/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping in England - data.gov.uk</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"historic-releases\">Historic Releases</h2>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20240402211011/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2022 to 2023</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230821231156/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2021 to 2022</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england/local-authority-fly-tipping-enforcement-league-tables-for-england-202122?preview=false\" class=\"govuk-link\">Local authority fly-tipping enforcement league tables for England, 2021/22</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20220104175558/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2020 to 2021</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20210618184143/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2019 to 2020</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20200303093903/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2018 to 2019</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20191101220726/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2017 to 2018</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20180228134511/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2016 to 2017</a></p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20170908124407/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england\" class=\"govuk-link\">Fly-tipping statistics for England, 2015 to 2016</a></p>\n\n<p>The next release see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/announcements\" class=\"govuk-link\">statistics release calendar</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"contact contact\" id=\"contact_7442\">\n    <p class=\"govuk-body\">Defra statistics: Waste and Recycling</p>\n\n\n    <div>\n        <p class=\"govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-4\">\n          Email <a class=\"govuk-link\" href=\"mailto:WasteStatistics@defra.gov.uk\">WasteStatistics@defra.gov.uk</a>\n        </p>\n\n\n    </div>\n\n\n</div>\n</div>",
