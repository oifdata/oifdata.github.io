Long-term increase: the fish are shifting back towards larger species\n2. No long-term change: no change in the composition of fish communities\n3. Long-term decrease: more smaller species than in an earlier period but less than in a more recent one\n4. Decrease to minimum observed state: the community has the highest proportion of small species recorded",
