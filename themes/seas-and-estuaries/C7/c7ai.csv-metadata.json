Long-term increase: an increase in the size of fish within the community over the period\n2. No long-term change: no change in the size of fish\n3. Long-term decrease: the size of fish in the community has decreased from an earlier period but has increased from a more recent period\n4. Decrease to minimum observed state: the fish in the community are currently at the lowest size recorded",
