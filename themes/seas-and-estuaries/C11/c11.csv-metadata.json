    "notes": "Figure C11 is based on the assessment results for 33 sensitive fish species found in fisheries surveys in the Greater North Sea and in the Celtic Seas, 26 and 27 species in the long-term and short-term assessments respectively. Additionally, in both the long-term and short-term assessments for the Greater North Sea, 11 species had insufficient data to assess against thresholds. For the long and short term assessments for the Celtic Seas, 24 and 23 species respectively had insufficient data to assess against thresholds.  \n \nEach regional sea was surveyed multiple times and surveys can be conducted across differing extents of each regional sea. A mixed category has been included for those species where both increases and decreases were detected across the relevant region.  \n\nA more detailed assessment can be found on the OSPAR indicator page for the [Recovery in the Population Abundance of Sensitive Fish Species](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/quality-status-reports/qsr-2023/indicator-assessments/recovery-sensitive-fish-species/).",
