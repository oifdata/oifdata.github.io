    "notes": "Figure C11ii is based on the assessment results for sensitive fish species found in fisheries surveys in the Celtic Seas and capable to support assessment i.e., 26 and 27 species in the long-term and short-term assessments respectively. Additionally, in the long-term and short-term assessments, 24 and 23 species respectively had insufficient data to assess against thresholds.  \n\nEach regional sea was surveyed multiple times and surveys can be conducted across differing extents of each regional sea. A mixed category has been included for those species whereby both increases and decreases were detected across the relevant region \n\nA more detailed assessment can be found on the OSPAR indicator page for the [Recovery in the Population Abundance of Sensitive Fish Species](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/quality-status-reports/qsr-2023/indicator-assessments/recovery-population-abundance-sensitive-fish-species/).",
