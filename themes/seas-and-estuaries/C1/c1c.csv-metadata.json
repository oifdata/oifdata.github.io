    "notes": "Trends in UK seafloor litter are represented by spatially smoothed predictions of the median total number of pieces of litter per km, at a grid of points. The colours represent differing relative medians. This is using data combined over the years, although similar patterns are present in the data for the individual years. More data are required to make a full assessment of the trend in the amount of seafloor litter in specific areas of UK waters.",
