Reported figures and supporting text have shown how indicator trends change over time but indicators have not stated whether change is in a favourable direction for meeting environmental goals. A new assessment section has been added to the 2022 update of the report and dashboard, to help with interpreting results and to allow for easier comparison across indicators and to enable the production of additional summary statistics.\n\nConsistent categories of change for different time periods have been assigned to all indicators which are already published in a suitable format and with sufficient historic data to enable analysis. Indicator-specific results with a supporting narrative are provided for each indicator within the relevant indicator specific pages of this dashboard.\n\nWhere data are available for individual indicators, an assessment of environmental change since 2018 has been undertaken, to reflect progress made since the publication of the 25 Year Environment Plan. However, it is important to note that for most indicators, the currently available time series of data points since 2018 does not yet allow for anything more than an early indication of likely change. It is expected that the ongoing annual updates of the Outcome Indicator Framework will in time allow for statistically robust assessment of changes since 2018. This will require more than 5 data points in a given indicator’s time series since 2018 to minimise the impact of year-to-year fluctuations which make it difficult to interpret a clear trend. For this reason, care should be taken to not overinterpret offered assessments for the ‘since 2018’ category, as this is not felt to be as robust an assessment as the other categories which have more datapoints informing their analysis.\n\nThere are important considerations to be aware of when interpreting results. These are highlighted in the assessment background section of this dashboard, a new addition which also provides more detail on the aims of the assessment and the methodology employed. The assessment results section presents summaries of assessment results by each 25 Year Environment Plan Goal. These summaries help to interpret how much change has been observed across goals and include information on potential links between indicators for different goals to indicate where there may be knock on effects.\n","id":""},"/contact-us/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/contact-us/","title":"Contact us\n","content":"Feedback\n\nTo provide specific feedback about this website, please complete our feedback survey.\n\nEmail\n\n\n25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk\n\n\nWe aim to respond within 10 working days\n\nTelephone\n\n\nUK only: +44 (0)3459 33 55 77\nOutside UK: +44 (0)20 7238 6951\n\n\nMonday to Friday, 8:30am to 5pm\n\nClosed Saturday and Sunday\n\n\nCalls to (0)345 cost the same as calling 01 and 02 within your call package.

The 2019 report set out in detail the purpose of the Outcome Indicator Framework and examples of how the indicators can be used.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework has an important role in our longer-term understanding of the effectiveness of policies and interventions. The indicators are a systematic means of monitoring environmental change, recognising that complex natural and social systems will respond to change on a range of timescales.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework will:\n\n\n  enable clear communication of important environmental trends in England;\n  provide a set of indicators which relate to all aspects of the environment and all goals within the 25 Year Environment Plan;\n  communicate data which gives a high-level picture of the environment and how it is changing – more extensive data and indicators may additionally be available from other sources;\n  be used for assessment of changes in the natural environment, for example against the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan, or in applying a natural capital approach.\n\n\nWhat is a natural capital approach?\n\nNatural capital is defined as the ‘elements of the environment which provide valuable goods and services to people such as clean air, clean water, food and recreation’. A natural capital approach is advocated by the 25 Year Environment Plan as it accounts for all the different ways the environment benefits society and so can inform better decision making and the concept of natural capital was used to develop the Outcome Indicator Framework. A natural capital approach sets out the need to:\n\n\n  reduce pressures on natural capital (for example, pollution or plant disease);\n  improve the state of natural assets (including air, water, land and seas);\n  increase the benefits that we get from those assets.\n\n\nThe 66 outcome indicators can be considered as either a measure of (a) the pressure on natural capital assets, (b) the extent/condition of natural capital assets or (c) the service or benefit associated with natural capital assets. This classification is not always straightforward since the condition of one natural capital asset (for example, air quality) may place a pressure on another (for example, wildlife habitat). It is important to recognise that multiple interactions occur across the indicators and categories. By classifying these indicators in this way, we can also show which direction of change in the indicator reflects an improvement to environment (that is, a downward trend for pressures and an upward trend for the condition of an asset or the provision of a benefit).\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\n\nWe have used 3 categories of reporting status for the indicators:\n\n\n  Final – no further significant development of the indicator is immediately expected, notwithstanding the future development of the framework as a whole.\n  Interim – further development is necessary for the indicator to be complete; for example, England-level data may need to be extracted from a UK wide dataset, additional data may need to be added to the indicator, or the methods used for deriving an indicator are expected to be further developed.\n  In development – the indicator is not currently available to report; further research is required and/or ongoing to determine the most suitable data and methods for analysis.\n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nIs the Outcome Indicator Framework an official or National Statistics publication?\n\nAlthough the report and this dashboard are not classified as official statistics or a National Statistic compendium publication, where possible we follow the UK’s Code of Practice for Statistics in its production and in the compilation of the indicator framework within it. The Official statistics section of this website explains how we have demonstrated voluntary compliance with many parts of the Code, in line with the Guide for Voluntary Application of the Code.\n\nWhat are experimental statistics?\n\nExperimental statistics are newly developed or innovative statistics published so that users and stakeholders can be involved in the assessment of their suitability and quality at an early stage. If you have feedback on any of our experimental statistics in the Outcome Indicator Framework, please email us at &lt;{{ site.email_contact }}&gt;.\n\nHow often will new data be added to this site?\n\nWhere possible, we will provide annual updates to the Outcome Indicator Framework; these will include the introduction of new indicators together with updates to existing indicators we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible, in cooperation with topic experts.\n\nHow do I suggest new or different data sources?\n\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please email us at &lt;{{ site.email_contact }}&gt;.\n\nWhat are you doing to fill data gaps?\n\nThe technologies for monitoring and assessing change in the environment are advancing rapidly and offer new cost-effective methods (for example, Earth Observations, DNA methods, citizen science/mobile apps and new sensor technologies). We will look to update indicators to reflect these developments when appropriate but will ensure the environmental parameters used for reporting indicators are consistent and so retain the trend time-series.\n\nWill the indicators be used to assess progress?\n\nIn the future, the Outcome Indicator Framework will be used for assessments of environmental change. Research into potential assessment approaches is taking place considering appropriate statistical techniques and timeframes.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\n\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. We are working towards meeting AA level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), however we are aware of some issues at a higher compliance level such as:\n\n\n  Assistive technology can’t read charts or maps on the site so please use the data table view instead.\n  If you are using Internet Explorer, you won’t be able to sort or filter data tables with keyboard navigation so please download the data files to sort and filter data.\n\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\n\nWe are developing and testing our site in line with the Government Digital Service (GDS) guidance on designing for different browsers and devices. Our website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers listed in the ‘Browsers to test in’ section of the GDS guidance.\n\nIs this website related to the UK’s SDG data website?\n\nThis website is built using the same OpenSDG platform as the UK’s Sustainable Development Goals data website, but we have adapted it to meet the specific needs and presentational requirements of the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n\nCan other organisations copy this website?\n\nYes. This site is built and hosted using 100% free software and services, so other organisations can freely and easily reuse our code. Technical guidance on implementing this platform is available here.\n\nFor further questions about the Outcome Indicator Framework site please contact us.\n\nBack to top\n","id":""},"/future-development/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/future-development/","title":"Future development\n","content":"Currently, some indicators are not yet available to report, and further research is required to determine the most suitable data and methods for analysis. We expect additional indicators to be reported in 2023 and subsequent years.\n\nThe technologies for monitoring and assessing change in the environment are advancing rapidly and offer new cost-effective methods (for example, Earth Observations, DNA methods, citizen science / mobile apps and new sensor technologies). We will look to update indicators to reflect these developments when appropriate but will ensure the environmental parameters used for reporting indicators are consistent and so retain the trend time-series where possible.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework will be kept under regular review so that it continues to be relevant and provide the best and most cost-effective ways of assessing progress. The framework will be reviewed as a minimum every 5 years.\n\nIn order to add value to the insights available from the Outcome Indicator Framework data, this year’s report and dashboard includes initial assessment of change analyses, where suitable datasets and methodologies were available for individual indicators.\n\nFurther research into potential assessment approaches is ongoing, considering appropriate statistical techniques and timeframes. In future years, this may focus on the indicator headlines and their corresponding indicators (identified in Tables 1a to 1j of our 2022 Outcome Indicator Framework report). Where possible, a baseline near to 2018 (to align with the publication of the 25 Year Environment Plan) will be used as a reference point to assess change. Longer-term (historic) trends will also be presented for comparison where these data are available. Where suitable time-series are available, we will also assess medium-term and short-term trends.\n\nIt is important to note that data series of less than 5 years are likely to show year-to-year fluctuations that are difficult to assess and as such, due caution should be taken when inferring meaning from the assessments represented. Further narrative is provided for individual indicator analyses which is important for contextualisation of results.\n\nIt is also important to note that time lags exist in the environmental responses to interventions. It is expected that the majority of outcome indicators will require longer-term reporting (greater than 5 years) before they may be considered as showing response to policy and other actions.\n","id":""},"/impact-of-coronavirus/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/impact-of-coronavirus/","title":"Impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\n","content":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had severe and wide-ranging effects on many formerly routine activities.

In particular, the Outcome Indicator Framework can support the statutory cycle of monitoring, planning and reporting on progress in improving the environment as established by the Environment Act, (2021).\n\nThe first Outcome Indicator Framework report: ‘Measuring environmental change: Outcome Indicator Framework for the 25 Year Environment Plan’, was published in May 2019.

The remaining 10 indicators presented in 2021 have not been updated as no new data were available for inclusion in the 2022 dashboard at the time of analysis. This year’s update also includes data for 5 additional indicators newly reported with interim status in 2022:\n\n\n  C11 Productive seas: status of sensitive fish and shellfish stocks\n  G3: Enhancement of green/blue infrastructure\n  G6: Environmental attitudes and behaviours\n  G7: Health and wellbeing benefits\n  K1: Overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities\n\n\nFour of the indicators presented in this 2022 update to the dashboard are classified as ‘experimental statistics’:\n\n\n  B3: State of the water environment\n  H4: Exposure and adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife in the environment\n  K1: Overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities\n  K4: Extent and condition of terrestrial and marine protected areas in the UK Overseas Territories\n\n\nThese indicators are being published as experimental statistics in order to facilitate user involvement in their development – information on how the data have been obtained and how the indicators have been prepared is available via the links in the individual indicator pages of this dashboard. We would welcome any feedback, particularly on the usefulness and value of these statistics, via 25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk.\n\nIn addition, underpinning data for J1: Carbon footprint and consumer buying choices are sourced from datasets originally published elsewhere as experimental statistics.\n\nOf the 50 indicators presented, 33 are described as interim indicators. Interim indicators are those where further development is expected to extend or improve the reporting of the indicator. Reporting interim indicators means that we can communicate data where they are available, whilst recognising that further development is necessary for the indicator to be complete. Examples of circumstances under which an indicator is considered to be interim include: data need to be extracted for England from a UK wide dataset, additional data need to be added to the indicator, or the methods used for deriving an indicator are expected to be further developed. The specific reason why an indicator is currently presented as interim is described in the individual indicator pages of this dashboard. Indicators are described as ‘final’ indicators where no further significant development is immediately expected, notwithstanding the future development of the framework as a whole.\n\nA list of the 50 indicators for which data trends are reported is included in Tables 2a to 2i of our 2022 Outcome Indicator Framework report.\n\nA limited number of changes have been made to the indicator descriptions over the last year. These reflect feedback as well as further consideration and development of the indicators to ensure the most appropriate data are presented.\n\nThere have been some specific changes to individual indicators after further consideration of their intended purpose, in order to better reflect alignment with 25 Year Environment Plan commitments and to deliver the insights required to support associated policy needs.\n\nExtended definition under B6: Natural functions of water and wetland ecosystems to include reference to a Natural England report that will form the foundation of the indicator research and development.\n\nThe short descriptions of C7: Healthy seas: fish and shellfish populations and C8: Healthy seas: marine food webs functioning have received minor changes for clarification.\n\nC10: Productive seas: fish and shellfish stocks fished sustainably has been revised to include new categories for stocks that have been fished in an acceptable mortality range, as defined by internationally agreed Multi-Annual Plans for fisheries. A reference to the previous location for these data (see E9: Percentage of our seafood coming from healthy ecosystems, produced sustainably) has also been removed from the short description as this change occurred in the previous (2021) publication.\n\nThe short descriptions of indicators D1: Quantity, quality and connectivity of habitats and D2: Extent and condition of protected sites – land, water and sea have received minor changes for clarification. The list of protected areas in D2 has also been corrected, to more accurately reference the inclusion of Marine Conservation Zones.\n\nThe short description of G1: Changes in landscape and waterscape character has been updated to more accurately capture the information that feeds into the indicator and describe the components that will be included now that development had progressed further. The short description for G3: Enhancement of green/blue infrastructure has been altered to update information on Green Infrastructure Standards. The short descriptions for indicators G4: Engagement with the natural environment, G5: People engaged in social action for the environment, G6: Environmental attitudes and behaviours and G7: Health and wellbeing benefits have been updated to better reflect the scope of the datasets informing them, now information from the People and Nature Survey has been, or will soon be, incorporated.\n\nA minor change has been made to the short description of J1: Carbon footprint and consumer buying choices to clarify the difference between it and A2: Emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources.\n\nThe description of K1: Overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities has been updated to better reflect the indicator now that it is published for the first time this year. This is to provide a more comprehensive insight into the modelling underpinning the indicator.\n\nA minor change has been made to the short description for K2: Developing countries better able to protect and improve the environment with UK support.

These are topics that people will generally recognise as relating to different aspects of the environment (for example, air, water, seas and estuaries, and wildlife). Some indicators may be applicable to one or more themes but have been allocated to just one of them. A full list of indicators by theme, headline status (where relevant) and primary goal in the 25 Year Environment Plan is provided in Tables 1a to 1j of the 2022 Outcome Indicator Framework report and detailed descriptions of each of the indicators are presented in the individual indicator pages of this dashboard. The 25 Year Environment Plan goals and targets relevant to each indicator are also detailed within these descriptions.\n\nThe inclusion of 66 indicators in the framework provides a comprehensive and systematic means to observe and convey environmental change. However, for some purposes it may not be necessary to examine this large number of indicators. Therefore, in the framework we identify a sub-set of the indicators under 16 headlines; these are highlighted in Tables 1a to 1j of the 2022 Outcome Indicator Framework report and in the individual indicator pages of this dashboard. The headline indicators relate to key aspects of the environment which are a focus of policy intervention and should make intuitive sense to a wide range of readers. When complete, the framework will present a large amount of information and so we will highlight key indicators under headlines to provide a way to simplify this information and provide clear communication.\n\nFurther examples on how the headlines and indicators may be used are given in Section B of the 2019 Outcome Indicator Framework report.\n","id":""},"/using-the-framework/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/using-the-framework/","title":"Using the framework\n","content":"The Outcome Indicator Framework is designed to be adaptable for multiple uses.

Area of woodland in England","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator shows change in the area of broadleaved and conifer woodland in England. Woodland as defined for the National Forest Inventory is land under stands of trees with a minimum area of 0.5 hectares, a width of at least 20 metres, and a canopy cover of at least 20% or having the potential to achieve this. The definition relates to land use, rather than land cover, so integral open space and areas of felled trees that are awaiting restocking (replanting) are included as woodland. Woodland is a key natural capital asset that provides many natural capital benefits, such as the provision of timber and other wood products, carbon storage, habitats for wildlife, and opportunities for exercise and recreation.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on the area of woodland are published annually in Forest Research’s Forestry Statistics along with information on the data sources and methodology. Additional commentary on recent trends and new planting of woodland and trees in England is provided in the Forestry Commission’s quarterly Key Performance Indicators.\n\nTrend description for Figure D3\n\nThe total area of woodland in England has increased from 1.19 million hectares in 1980 to 1.32 million hectares in 2021, equating to an increase from 9.1% to 10.1% of the land area of England. This growth has been driven by an increase in broadleaf woodland. The area of conifer woodland in England has remained relatively static over the last 40 years.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nOver the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2016 to 2021) and in the medium term (2011 to 2021), the observed increases in the area of woodland in England count as ‘little or no change’. This is because it would take a large area of additional woodland cover to reach the +3% change needed to for the ‘improvement’ category to be assigned. There has been an increase (improvement) over the long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.

NO2 arises predominantly from combustion sources such as traditionally fuelled vehicles and therefore the highest concentrations are often found at roadside locations.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as a pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the average value of the annual mean concentrations measured across Defra’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) at all roadside locations (with greater than 75% data capture in any one year).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on concentrations of NO2 are published annually as National Statistics; Air Quality Statistics.\n\nTrend description for Figure A5\n\nConcentrations of roadside NO2 in England have fallen from 59.7μg per m3 in 1997 to 23.0μg per m3 in 2020, a drop of 49% over the latest 23 years for which data are available. Although the general trend in measured NO2 concentrations is decreasing and falls below the NO2 limit value of 40μg per m3 in recent years, there are hotspots of NO2 exceedances which are being addressed through the NO2 plans.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nRoadside NO2 concentrations decreased (an improvement) over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and over the medium and long-term time periods. Targets for NO2 are set at a regional scale rather than for the England average recorded by this indicator, so it would not be appropriate to use results to establish whether targets have been met.\n\nYou can find more information on trends and monitoring at a regional level can be found in the Air Pollution in the UK report.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. A decrease in roadside NO2 concentrations was also observed since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

For mercury, which is covered by the Minamata Convention, combustion sources are particularly significant, and information on emissions is provided annually by larger industrial sites. Other major sources of mercury to air will be gathered from different data sources.\n\nPOPs are chemicals that are extremely persistent in the environment, become widely distributed geographically, are able to accumulate in the tissues of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health and the environment. POPs within this indicator refers to pollutants listed under Annex C (unintentional produced) of the Stockholm Convention. The Convention covers a range of substances spanning industrial uses, pesticides, and unintentionally produced substances.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in a final format in 2022 as further development is required to bring data together from a number of different sources. A revised interim indicator is presented here that shows annual England-level emissions of (a) mercury from larger industrial sites and crematoria, and (b) 7 unintentionally produced POP substances (as listed in the Stockholm Convention Annex C): polychlorinated biphenyls; dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls; dioxins and furans; hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated naphthalenes; pentachlorophenol; and pentachlorobenzene from a wide range of sources to air, land, and water. These POPs data are a disaggregation of the annual UK-level data previously presented in this indicator.\n\nSome information is already published: Pollution Inventory, National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, Persistent Organic Pollutants Multimedia Emissions Inventory, and National Reports for the Stockholm Convention. Population estimates used to apportion some UK emissions of POPs at an England level are also published annually.\n\nFor further information on the methodology used to produce this indicator email chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk.\n\nTrend description for Figures H3a and H3b\n\nH3a) Emissions of mercury to air, land and water\n\nIn 2019, emissions of mercury from larger industrial sites and crematoria in England totalled 1,652 kg, with larger industrial sites accounting for 68% of this figure.\n\nH3b) Emissions of persistent organic pollutants to air, land and water\n\nEmissions attributed to England for all 7 POPs included within this indicator have fallen between 2000 and 2019.\n\nDioxins and furans are a family of chemicals strongly associated with thermal processes linked to combustion (particularly of waste) and manufacture of metals. Their emissions were already reduced by over 60% between 1990 and 2000, with improvements in technology and tighter environmental regulations contributing to this fall. Between 2000 and 2010, emissions of dioxins and furans fell by a further 43% but have since levelled out, with emissions post-2010 largely linked to more diffuse sources such as domestic combustion of solid fossil fuels, accidental fire, and illegal burning of waste.\n\nBy 2013, emissions of hexachlorobenzene had fallen to 27% of their 2000 baseline figure but they have risen annually since then to reach 52% of emissions in 2000. This is linked to waste incineration and the increasing use of a specific pesticide (chlorothalonil) for which it is a by-product. Emissions of pentachlorophenol have fallen consistently since 2000 to reach 31% of their baseline figure in 2019. Emissions of the remaining 4 POPs have followed a very similar pattern to each other, falling sharply in the first 10 years and then levelling out to between 11% and 18% of their baseline figures in 2019. In particular for polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, this relates to remaining final in-use stocks of heat-transfer fluids in di-electric equipment in the energy transmission networks.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nA decrease (or improvement) was observed for all emissions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to air land and water covered by the interim H3 indicator, over the medium and long term. Most POPs also decrease over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018); however, little or no change was seen in emission of polychlorinated naphthalenes during this period, and there was an increase (deterioration) in hexachlorobenzene.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there has been a mixed picture with 3 POPs decreasing, 3 showing little or no change, and hexachlorobenzene increasing. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Separate statistics are available for softwood, hardwood, and both in total. This indicator helps us to better understand the levels of, and trends in, the economic productive utilisation of English timber resources as a part of sustainable forest management policies and practices.\n\nThe underlying data sources are National Statistics from Forest Research on UK Wood Production and Trade and National Forest Inventory forecasts of increase (increment) in the volume of wood that grows in England.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on the percentage of the annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested are published in the Forestry Commission’s Key Performance Indicators Reports.\n\nTrend description for Figure E5\n\nThe percentage of softwood growth in England which is harvested has fluctuated between 67% and 92% over the 11 years for which these data are reported, reflecting sustained active management of softwood resources. The percentage of hardwood growth which is harvested has increased slightly, although it remains much lower (between 13% and 20% over the same 11-year period), reflecting a lower level of active management of broadleaved woodland for timber supplies.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the percentage of the total annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested (hardwood and softwood combined) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020).

They were identified to support UK conservation planning and are published and maintained by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Priority species are used as the reference source to produce statutory species lists of principal conservation importance. Such lists are published by the Secretary of State under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. There are over 940 priority species recognised in England.\n\nThis indicator has 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those priority species for which suitable abundance data are available; and (b) changes in distribution (the number of 1km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of those priority species for which distribution data are available. The relative abundance of a species will increase when the population of the species grows; it will decrease when the population of the species declines. The occupancy index will increase when a species becomes more widespread; it will decrease when a species becomes less widespread.\n\nThe taxonomic coverage of this indicator is limited at present. The relative abundance measure includes priority birds, butterflies, some mammals (one hare and 5 bats) and moths but does not currently include plants, fungi, amphibians, reptiles, fish or invertebrates other than butterflies and moths; the distribution measure includes priority species of bryophytes, lichens, insects and other invertebrates but does not currently include amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish or mammals.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. Trends for the relative abundance and distribution of priority species at an England-level were presented here for the first time in 2021 as a revised interim indicator, but there are no new data available to update this indicator in 2022. Further details about this indicator, including a technical background document that describes the data sources and methods in detail, and spreadsheets that contain a list of species within each index together with the data behind the indices are published annually as England Biodiversity Indicators 4a and 4b – Status of priority species: relative abundance and distribution. Methods are being developed to refine the future reporting of this indicator and to expand the taxonomic coverage.\n\nThese methods are still undergoing peer review and user feedback is invited via 25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk.\n\nNote on Figures D6ai, D6aii, D6bi and D6bii\n\nOf the more than 940 species in the priority species list for England, 149 have robust quantitative time-series data on relative abundance and 181 have suitable distribution data. The relative abundance measure comprises Birds (44), Butterflies (21), Mammals (6) and Moths (78); the distribution measure comprises Bees (13), Bryophytes (9), Lichens (16), Moths (93), Spiders (9), Wasps (7), and 34 species representing other taxonomic groups. Approximately 60 species of moths appear in both the relative abundance and distribution measures; the remaining species within this indicator are unique to one or other of the measures because they are drawn from different data sources. The abundance datasets are generated largely from data collected by national monitoring schemes, whereas the distribution data are collated through the Biological Records Centre and include contributions from a wide range of national recording schemes (see the technical background document referenced in the ‘Readiness and links to data’ section for further detail).\n\nTrend description for Figures D6ai, D6aii, D6bi and D6bii\n\nD6a) Changes in abundance of priority species\n\nBy 2018, the index of relative abundance of priority species in England had declined to 17.7% of its base-line value in 1970, a statistically significant decrease. Over this long-term period, 7% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 83% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2013 and 2018, the relative abundance index declined from 21.3 to 17.7 (17% of the 2013 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 20% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 56% showed a strong or weak decline.\n\nD6b) Changes in distribution of priority species\n\nBy 2016, the index of distribution of priority species in England decreased to 84, a statistically significant decrease of 16% of the 1970 value. Over this long-term period, 24% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 38% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2011 and 2016, the distribution index declined from 92.3 to 83.7 (9% of the 2011 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 13% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 59% showed a strong or weak decline.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nIndicators for relative abundance and distribution of priority species in England are also reported in the England Biodiversity Indicators, which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is more tailored to the specific dataset and factors-in information on confidence. No results were available for the medium-term period using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology, although this will be considered for the next publication. The assessment found a decrease (or deterioration) in both the relative abundance and distribution of priority species in England over the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There were also decreases recorded over the long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in sections 4a and b of the latest England Biodiversity Indicators report.

Green and blue spaces and other natural features in and around our built environment, including within Green Belts, are part of networks of multi-functional green infrastructure, which are capable of delivering a wide range of benefits that are essential to health and wellbeing, nature, climate, water and prosperity. Green and blue infrastructure includes land, freshwater and coastal spaces.\n\nThis indicator will be developed from work led by Natural England, with Defra and an advisory group, on a new Green Infrastructure Framework – Principles and Standards for England which will cover both green and blue infrastructure. These standards aim to green our towns and cities, by improving existing green infrastructure provision and encouraging more investment. Green and blue infrastructure can also make an important contribution towards adaptation to climate change.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. However, an interim indicator is presented here, which is based on Natural England’s updated Accessible Natural Greenspace Standards (ANGSt). These standards will inform the development of indicators for accessible greenspace quantity and proximity, at different scales.\n\nNatural England and Defra have also developed initial baseline maps of Green and Blue Infrastructure across England (version 1.1), for analysis using the updated ANGSt and other standards and indicators in development. The England Green Infrastructure Mapping Database Report provides details of the Green Infrastructure Mapping datasets and analysis (and of the updated ANGSt). Initial findings are published on the Green Infrastructure Mapping Database and Analyses webpage.\n\nThe ANGSt include a measure of hectares of Local Nature Reserve (LNR) per 1,000 population, and this analysis will be undertaken using data on LNRs held in Designated Sites View to report in 2023.\n\nOutputs of further analysis of the Green Infrastructure Mapping will be considered for providing additional information in the final indicator, including more detailed statistical analysis of population shares within ANGSt buffers by index of deprivation, population density and green space per 1,000 population, and also access to waterside and linear access such as Public Rights of Way.\n\nInformation on changes in the public’s perceptions of green and blue space quality and access to green and blue spaces is now gathered by Natural England using the People and Nature Survey (PANS) for England. A new indicator, derived from the PANS results, is in development.\n\nNote on Figure G3\n\nFigure G3 covers both urban and rural areas.

The combined greenspace category, while not a standard in itself, includes the percentage of the population with access to any one or more of the doorstep greenspace, and local and neighbourhood natural greenspace standards.\n\nTrend description for Figure G3\n\nThis is the baseline year of data; we aim to build a time series that is updated at the frequency new mapping is undertaken. As of October 2021, the proportions of the total population in England living within ANGSt ‘buffers’ (straight line distances from the boundary of the greenspaces) are:\n\n\n  1 in 3 people live within 200m of a doorstep greenspace of at least 0.5 hectares\n  1 in 4 people live within 300m of a local natural greenspace of at least 2 hectares, and\n  1 in 2 people live within 1km of a neighbourhood natural greenspace of at least 10 hectares\n\n\nWhen considered together, these 3 most local ANGSt buffers allow us to form a composite picture of accessible greenspace. Initial findings suggest that, as of October 2021, almost 2 in 3 people (62.2%) have access to greenspace as defined by one or more of the doorstep greenspace, local natural greenspace and neighbourhood natural greenspace standards included within this indicator, and hence within a maximum 1km radius of home.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","id":"7.3.1"},"/3-1-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/3-1-1","title":"Indicator 3.1.1 - Clean seas: marine litter","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator of clean seas shows changes in the amount of litter in the marine environment, including litter on beaches, on the seafloor and floating litter. Beach litter surveys are completed annually or quarterly and cover a representative number of beaches. Data from trawl surveys, typically carried out for fish stock assessments, are used to monitor the amount of litter on the seafloor. After each tow all litter items are emptied from the net and counted and classified. Beached fulmars or individuals accidently killed are collected as part of a monitoring programme in the Greater North Sea to assess the plastics found in their stomachs. Fulmars forage exclusively at sea, generally at the surface of the water. The amount of plastic they ingest can be used as a proxy for the abundance of floating litter in their environment and how this is changing. Indicators for seafloor litter, beach litter and litter found in Fulmar stomachs have been developed and expert groups are working to improve the data. Additional monitoring programmes are being developed to record the amount of microplastics in sediment and in biota.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows 3 aspects of litter in the marine environment: a) beach litter b) plastic in fulmar stomachs and c) seafloor litter. The assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019). Data, analytical methods and assessments on Marine litter are available, as are fulmar data from 2011-2015 to 2015-2019.\n\nThe litter dashboard also includes some beach litter data beyond 2015 but this is not directly comparable to C1a. Additional commentary on recent trends in the C1b indicator is published in the latest research report from Wageningen University to Defra (Project code ME5227) which supports reporting commitments under OSPAR.\n\nFurther development of this indicator is required, and the indicator’s format will evolve.\n\nNote on Figures C1a, C1b and C1c\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessments of marine litter. They enable an understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTrend description for Figures C1a, C1b and C1c\n\nC1a) Beach litter\n\nThe average total abundance of beach litter items per 100m of coast varies considerably around the UK with greater quantities being recorded in the Celtic Seas than in the Greater North Sea. After showing some decrease from 2009 to 2011, beach litter levels in the Celtic Seas, whilst fluctuating, have risen to greater than the 2008 levels. In the Greater North Sea, there has been an increase in beach litter levels. Water currents, weather conditions, and prevailing wind conditions can have an influence on the deposition and retention of beach litter and therefore beach litter abundance. In all beach litter regions, the majority of litter items were made of plastic (including polystyrene). Plastic fragments are the most commonly found type of litter item, followed by food and drinks packaging, sewage related debris and then smaller amounts of fishing-related litter.\n\nC1b) Fulmars\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014 approximately 60% of surveyed (beached) fulmars in the Greater North Sea region were found to have more than 0.1g of plastic (the threshold level used in the OSPAR target definition) in their stomachs. This reflects the abundance of floating litter in their environment. More recently, the measure appears to show some decline, but not to an extent that is statistically significant.\n\nC1c) Seafloor litter\n\nFrom sampling UK seafloor litter to date higher amounts of litter and plastic have been found per km2 of seafloor in the Greater North Sea compared to the Celtic Seas. There were also higher amounts of seafloor litter in the southern parts of the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, which could be a result of increasing human pressures.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThe time series for interim C1a indicator Items of litter per 100m of beach runs from 2008 to 2015 which is not yet long enough to produce an assessment for medium and long-term time periods. A decrease in beach litter (or improvement) was observed in the Celtic Seas region over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2009 to 2014), but an increase (or deterioration) was observed in the Greater North Sea region.\n\nA decrease (or improvement) in the percentage of sampled fulmars which have more than 0.1g of plastic in their stomach was observed over the short, medium, and long-term time periods. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed for indicator components which had sufficient data. Little or no change in the fulmar indicator was observed since 2018. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nThe assessment results reported here are not directly comparable with other analyses published elsewhere that use different methodologies to explore these indicators or are based on alternative datasets.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

There are still gaps in the data and these will need to be addressed in order to provide reporting by source sector.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in waste landfilled or incinerated (with and without energy recovery) in England, excluding major minerals. Some data are available via the Environment Agency’s Waste data interrogator and incineration monitoring reports, but further work is required to split these data by source sector. This interim indicator, together with additional supporting methodology is also included within Defra’s Resources and waste strategy for England.\n\nNote on Figure J4\n\nFor the purposes of this indicator, residual waste refers to waste sent to landfill or incineration in England.\n\nThese data do not include exported waste figures. However, it is intended for these to be incorporated in the future.\n\nTrend description for Figure J4\n\nIn 2019, the total quantity of waste (excluding major mineral wastes) landfilled or incinerated in England was 29.1 million tonnes, a 5.0% reduction against levels in 2010 (30.6 million tonnes). This reduction was due to less waste being landfilled (falling by 44.1% over the period 2010 to 2019), and more waste being sent to incineration (increasing by 156.3% over the same period).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThe time series for interim J4 indicator Residual waste (excluding major mineral wastes) in England begins in 2010 which is not yet long enough to produce an assessment for medium and long-term time periods. The assessment shows trends for the total of both landfill and incineration waste. Missing data points for incineration waste were extrapolated to produce a continuous time series.

It shows the percentage of designated bathing waters meeting conditions sufficient to minimise the risk of harm to bathers from faecal pollution. It is based on a set of microbiological tests (measuring E.coli and intestinal enterococci) performed on waters used for bathing. The bacteria, if present, can cause severe stomach upsets and gastro-intestinal illness. Bathing waters are mainly coastal beaches but also include a number of inland freshwater lakes and one area on a river.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on Bathing water quality statistics are already published annually; longer-term trends are available in the State of the environment: water quality report.\n\nNote on Figure B4\n\nBathing waters in England were not classified in 2020 due to the severe impacts on bathing water monitoring and analysis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary adherence with government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nTrend description for Figure B4\n\nThe number of designated bathing waters in England meeting at least the minimum standard (sufficient, good or excellent) has increased considerably from 45.7% in 1995 to 99% in 2021. The majority of this increase occurred in the period to 2015; since then, the number meeting at least the minimum standard has remained relatively stable at between 97.1% and 99%. The number of bathing waters achieving excellent status has also increased considerably since 1995, with 70.7% meeting this standard in 2021. The number of bathing waters rated as poor has remained below 3% since 2015 (1% in 2021).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nAn assessment was undertaken using the B4 indicator to look at change in the percent of designated bathing waters meeting minimum standards of at least sufficient condition. A small increase (or improvement) in this metric was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020). A new method was introduced in 2015, so only data from that year onwards were included in the assessment. The new method is not directly comparable to the old method, so it is not appropriate to look at trends across both datasets. This meant there was not a sufficiently long time series for a medium or long-term assessment.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in the condition of bathing waters since 2018 with no reported data for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The assessment is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend. It should also be noted that in 2018 nearly 98% of designated bathing waters were already in at least sufficient condition so there is little scope for further improvement in this indicator.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Waste crime is a broad term encompassing fly-tipping, illegal waste sites, illegal waste exports, the misdescription of waste and illegal waste dumping, among other illegal waste-related activities. If not handled properly, waste can cause serious pollution of the environment – air, land and water, which can also be harmful to health. It further reduces the availability of resources from waste. Current data reported include illegal waste sites and fly-tipping. The underpinning data can be used to establish the level of criminal activity for some aspects of waste crime and geographic distribution. Options for further development will be considered, including the impacts and behavioural aspects of waste crime, the amount and types of potential resources lost through waste crime, and to reflect the need for targeting and effective enforcement to deliver reductions in the level of criminal activities.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the number of: (a) illegal waste sites and (b) fly-tipping incidents in England. Some data on illegal waste sites (waste crime) and fly-tipping are already published, but further work is required to develop the final indicator.\n\nTrend description for Figures J6a and J6b\n\nJ6a) Illegal waste sites\n\nThe total number of illegal waste sites in England fell from a peak of 1,011 active sites in the financial year 2011/2012 to 556 active sites in 2013/2014. Since then, the number increased gradually, reaching 685 sites in 2018/2019, before falling again to 470 sites in 2020/2021. Within this total, the number of active high-risk illegal waste sites fell by 44% from a peak of 353 sites in 2012/2013 to 197 sites in 2020/2021.\n\nJ6b) Fly-tipping incidents\n\nThe total number of fly-tipping incidents reported in England fell from 1.28 million incidents in the financial year 2007/2008 to 715,000 incidents in 2012/2013. Since these initial reductions, the number of incidents reported under the old methodology increased to over 1 million (1.07 million) between 2012/2013 and 2018/2019. The total number of fly-tipping incidents reported in 2018/2019 under the new methodology was 957,000. In the 2 years to 2020/2021, this total increased by 18.5% to 1.13 million incidents.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThere has been an improvement recorded over the medium term for both interim indicators for J6: J6a Illegal waste sites in England and J6b Fly-tipping incidents in England. However, in the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2012 to 2017), fly tipping incidents have begun to increase again (meaning a deterioration for the indicator) and progress has stalled for illegal waste sites with an assessment of ‘little or no change’.\n\nThe time series for both J6 indicator component’s are not yet long enough for a long-term assessment. A new methodology was introduced in 2018 for J6b but, as this was not directly comparable to the previous method and only 3 data points are so far available, just data based on the old method were included in the assessment.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Illegal waste sites decreased in 2019 (an improvement) while fly tipping incident increased (a deterioration).

The indicator comprises several metrics including percentage of water tests meeting good (or better) status for ecology and chemistry, percentage of water bodies achieving good ecological status, and compliance of waters specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and nature conservation. ‘Status’ refers to quality as measured under the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 (the WFD Regulations). Some of these data relating to protected sites are also included in indicator ‘D2 Extent and condition of protected sites – land, water and sea’.

An interim indicator is presented here that shows the total factor productivity for the UK. Data on total factor productivity for England by farm type are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\nTrend description for Figure E4\n\nOverall productivity is driven by both the output and input components. Total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK was 54% higher in 2020 than it was in 1973. There has been an overall long-term increase driven by both increased outputs and a fall in inputs, although the separate trends (see indicators E2 and E3) have followed different patterns. There is considerable annual variation, this variation being mainly driven by variation in output volumes, and over the most recent year (2020), total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK fell by 4.5%.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nLittle or no change in efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019). This is in contrast to increasing trends in the medium and long term. It is not possible to simplistically categorise any change as either an ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’ for the environment as this will depend on the farming practices driving change.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity since 2018, based on 3 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Fish are a good indicator of healthy freshwater environments, responding to changes in water quality (including temperature) and quantity, as well as the quality of river habitats, necessary to sustain healthy populations and enable migration throughout rivers to allow fish to complete their life cycles. Fish also provide an important recreational and economic benefit from freshwaters.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (a) the proportion of principal salmon rivers at risk in England and, additionally, (b) the classification of fish species within English rivers. B7a presents annually published national salmon stock data. For this assessment, each river’s salmon stocks are placed into one of 4 categories: at risk; probably at risk; probably not at risk; and not at risk. The results act as a proxy for whether a particular river is at risk or not. In addition, a second measure of freshwater health was included for the first time in 2021. Fish classification data for B7b reflect the status of fish populations within rivers assessed in England. The results show whether the status of a particular river is high; good; moderate; poor or bad for fish. These data contribute to the assessment of ecological status in rivers (B3a). Further work will examine the coverage of the indicator.\n\nTrend description for Figures B7a and B7b\n\nB7a) Salmon stock status\n\nThe overall status of salmon stocks across principal salmon rivers continues to show a decline over the period of this assessment. This continues a trend observed before the start of the time series (2006). The percentage of rivers in the ‘not at risk’ category fell from 21% in 2006 to 0% in 2014 where it remained until there was a slight (2 percentage point) recovery in 2020. The percentage of rivers that are probably not at risk has fallen by 9 percentage points over the 15 years covered by this indicator. The percentage of principal salmon rivers at risk in England has fluctuated considerably from year to year; but overall, the percentage at risk in 2020 (48%) was 10 percentage points higher than the equivalent figure for 2006 (38%). The percentage of rivers in the ‘probably at risk’ category has also increased over the same time period (by 19 percentage points, from 21% to 40%).\n\nB7b) Classification of fish\n\nThe data show a slight but consistent increase in the numbers of rivers classed as high and good ecological status for fish between 2009 and 2015 and a corresponding small decrease in numbers of rivers in the poor and bad categories. Indications are that there was no change in the proportions of rivers in the 5 different categories between 2016 and 2019. From 2015, a revised method for assessing status was introduced and there are not yet sufficient data points to assess a trend. The new method is not directly comparable to the old method, so it is not appropriate to assess trend across both datasets at this time.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nA decrease (or deterioration) for the principal salmon rivers classed as ‘Not at risk’ or ‘Probably at risk’ was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), as well as over the medium and long term. This indicator is derived from highly variable data as fish are susceptible to yearly weather patterns and have natural cycles in abundance. This reduces confidence that shorter-term assessment results reflect real trends rather than natural variation. A more marked deterioration is evident over the medium term, reflecting a steep drop after 2012.\n\nAn increase (or improvement) has been observed for the percent of English rivers classified as in high or good status based on fish, over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2009 to 2014). From 2015, a new method was introduced for assessing status and there are not yet sufficient data points to assess a trend. The new method is not directly comparable to the old method, so it is not appropriate to look at trends across both datasets. When a suitable time series is built up with the new method, this more recent data will be assessed. There is not a sufficiently long time series for making an assessment over the medium and long-term periods.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there has been an increase (or improvement) for the indicator for principal salmon rivers classed as ‘Not at risk’ or ‘Probably at risk’. However, this improvement is slight and is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend. Insufficient data are available to assess change since 2018 for classification of fish in English rivers.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

GHGs emitted directly by households (making up 21.0% of the footprint in 2018) were 9.6% lower in 2018 than in 2001 as a result of reductions in emissions associated with household-related heating. Total consumption-based emissions have been on a downward trajectory since 2004: the greatest contribution to this trend has come from the goods and services produced in England and consumed here; but emissions embedded in imports have also reduced substantially (36.3% and 33.7% respectively from the 2004 peak overall).

These area designations have been included as they focus on the protection of biodiversity and provide legal mechanisms for this protection. This indicator currently has 2 components: (a) extent of protected sites on land, freshwater and at sea and (b) condition of terrestrial SSSIs on land and water.

The area of sites at sea has increased substantially, by more than 8 times since the time series began in 1999 although the majority of this increase took place between 2011 and 2020. The area of sites on land and water has remained relatively stable over time, increasing by 7% between 1999 and 2021.\n\nD2b) Condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest\n\nThere has been a net decrease in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition; down from 44% in 2003 to 38.4% in 2021. The sudden drop in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition from 43.2% in 2010 to 36.6% in 2011 was largely due to a more rigorous application of the ‘Common Standard for Monitoring’ protocols in assessing unit condition. While there has been a small increase in the area in favourable condition over the last 10 years (from 36.6% in 2011 to 38.4% in 2021), the figure has fallen slightly in the latest year.

It will show changes in the coverage of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) across the UKOTs, from a 2020 baseline. The baseline is calculated using UKOT protected area extent data provided by UKOT governments. The areas are aggregated across UKOTs and geographical regions and percent coverage is calculated for the land and marine environments separately. The indicator will also demonstrate the condition of protected areas in the UKOTs, using aspects of protected area condition that can be assessed cost-effectively.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form.

Species are assessed for evidence of a significant increase or decrease in frequency of occurrence in the assessment period (2015 to 2020) compared to a reference period. There is an aspiration to reverse any long-term depletion of species populations, so the basis of the assessment is a long-term reference period inclusive of all years prior to the assessment period (that is 1967 to 2014). To identify whether depletion is ongoing or if signs of recovery are evident, a secondary short-term reference period is also defined (here, 2009 to 2014).\n\nFurther work to standardise the dataset is ongoing due to a change in the types of fishing equipment used to conduct the surveys over time.\n\nThe indicator provides an assessment of change in the occurrence of species identified as sensitive to fishing.

The PANS team welcomes collaboration and feedback via the PANS user hub.\n\nFurther work is underway to be able to finalise measures used for this indicator taken from PANS and C-PANS, including.\n\n\n  Scrutiny of the multiple questions relating to social action for the environment to assess how they should be used and whether a composite score can be used for the purposes of this indicator.\n  On-going collection of data past year 1 to allow for examination of trends over time.\n  Work to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on the trends for this indicator.\n\n\nTrend description for Figure G5\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, the index of the amount of time contributed by environmental volunteers in England has fluctuated, but, overall, it has increased by 42%.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nFuture Outcome Indicator Framework reports will present data from PANS on people engaged in social action for the environment. When a sufficient time series is available, we will make an assessment using this new indicator. In the meantime, only the interim indicator on volunteer time spent on the natural environment has been assessed. An increase (or improvement) was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as over the medium and long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. A decrease (or deterioration) in volunteer time spent on the natural environment was observed since 2018 (up to 2019). However, this is based on 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Air pollution has negative impacts on human health and the environment. Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. As well as being emitted directly, particulate matter can be formed in the atmosphere from reactions between other pollutants, of which SO2, NOX, NMVOCs and NH3 are the most important. NOX and NH3 emissions can be deposited in soils or in rivers and lakes, for example, through rain. Resulting nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses and by producing ozone (O3) which damages crops and leads to impacts on wildlife through enhanced nutrient levels.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of pressures on the atmosphere caused by the emissions of 5 key pollutants, which when concentrated in the air or deposited have impacts on human health and ecosystems.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nEmissions data are published annually in the Air Quality Pollutant Inventories 2005-2019.\n\nNote on Figure A1\n\nConsultation with the devolved administrations led to the agreement to limit updates to historic devolved administration air pollutant inventories to 2005 as this is the base year for legally binding emissions reductions commitments. This also allows more resource to be allocated to the development of more recent years of the time series for which there is better access to updated methods and data. A UK-wide historic time series of emissions remains available back to 1970, published as part of Defra’s annual emissions reporting each February.\n\nTrend description for Figure A1\n\nEmissions for all 5 key air pollutants (ammonia, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide) in England have fallen over the latest 15 years for which annual, country-level data are available. Emissions of SO2 have seen the greatest reductions, falling by 80% between 2005 and 2019. Emissions of NOx and NMVOCs and have also fallen considerably, by 53% and 37% respectively; emissions of PM2.5 and NH3 have fallen by 15% and 3% respectively over the same period.\n\nMore recently, the trends in annual emissions of PM2.5 and NMVOC have levelled off and emissions of NH3 have increased. For PM2.5, decreases in emissions from many sources have been partially offset by increases in emissions from residential burning (domestic combustion); emissions of PM2.5 from this source increased by 66% between 2005 and 2019.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nFour of the air pollutants measured by the A1 indicator have shown an improvement in the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), and over the medium and long-term time periods. However, emissions of NH3 have been increasing over the short and medium term. More detailed reporting mentioned in the ‘Readiness and links to data’ section for this indicator may provide insights into the factors behind this change in NH3 emissions. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. Projections towards air emissions targets set at a UK scale are available to supplement this assessment.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. SO2 and NOx emissions showed an improvement in 2019, while NH3, NMVOC and PM2.5 emissions showed little or no change. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

The municipal waste recycling rate is the fraction of household waste and waste similar in nature and composition to household waste, which is recycled. The indicator reflects levels of everyday waste that is recycled and not sent for final disposal. Development of the Defra ‘waste tracking’ tool and further integration with data collected by local authorities will close some of the data gaps and enable collection of more comprehensive data.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in ‘household waste’ and ‘waste from households’ recycling rates. These waste data are already published annually as National Statistics. Further development is required to include waste that is similar in nature and composition to household waste such as non-household municipal waste. Information is available about the development of Defra’s ‘waste tracking’ tool.\n\nTrend description for Figure J3\n\nIn the 2020/2021 financial year, the recycling rate for ‘waste from households’ was 43.8%, up 1.9 percentage points on the equivalent figure for 2010/2011 (when the measure was first reported), but down 1.7 percentage points since 2019/2020.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nIn 2011, there was a change in the methodology used to produce for the Municipal waste recycling rates indicator. As this was not directly comparable to the previous method, we have only assessed trends using data following the new method.

Heritage features enable us to understand how our landscapes have been formed and are an important aspect of landscape character that significantly contribute to our enjoyment and appreciation of the natural beauty. We have a particular responsibility to conserve heritage features of designated sites. The indicator uses information from SSSI condition assessments and information which supports the production of Historic England’s annual Heritage at Risk Register.\n\nAll geological (including geomorphological) features designated as SSSIs have first been subject to rigorous and systematic scientific assessment leading to their selection as nationally important Geological Conservation Review (GCR) sites. As of December 2021, there were 1,150 SSSIs in England designated wholly, or in part, for their geology, encompassing 1,679 features identified through the GCR. Many SSSIs contain more than one geological heritage feature.\n\nMonuments designated as Scheduled Monuments have been recognised by the Secretary of State as being nationally important. For a monument to be considered of national importance its surviving features, above and/or below the surface of the land or seabed, must have a particular significance that relates to its historic, traditional, architectural, artistic and/or archaeological interest. As of August 2021, there were 19,921 Scheduled Monuments in England.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData are available on SSSI condition assessments (as a searchable database), and as a data download of SSSI Monitored features. A programme of work was initiated in 2020, aimed at assessing the condition of previously unassessed geological features and reassessing the condition of features which have not been assessed for more than 6 years.\n\nData on Scheduled Monuments at risk are also available. These data have been collated over an extended time period as it is not currently possible to update them in full on a regular basis. It should be noted that during 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted upon data collection and collation, and depending on the region, site visits for assessment purposes were either not possible or very limited. Although the usual level of on-site checking of entries on, additions to and removals from the Heritage at Risk Register was not possible, desk-based assessments and updates were carried out.\n\nNote on Figures G2a and G2b\n\nThe observed increase in the percentage of geological and geomorphological heritage features in favourable condition from 2019 to 2021 and the absence of any major changes to the percentage of features in the unfavourable assessment categories over the same period is largely due to the timing of data inputted since the last update of this indicator. Most new assessments in favourable condition have been included in the 2021 results, whereas most unfavourable assessments are still being finalised and have therefore not been included yet. The resulting skew towards the percentage of heritage features in favourable condition relative to those in unfavourable condition should be resolved during the next scheduled update of this indicator in 2024, and current results for the unfavourable condition categories should be treated with caution.\n\nData on the condition of Scheduled Monuments in this indicator are based on archaeology assessments only. As of August 2021, 842 Scheduled Monuments have additional\ncondition assessments based on their built or structural remains; these have been omitted from this indicator.\n\nTrend description for Figures G2a and G2b\n\nG2a) Condition of geological and geomorphological heritage features of Sites of Special Scientific Interest\n\nIn total, 72% of all designated geological features have been assessed as in favourable condition as of December 2021 (a 12 percentage point increase in the equivalent figure for 2019) and a further 7% have been assessed as unfavourable but recovering. Approximately 1% have been destroyed or partially destroyed.\n\nG2b) Condition of Scheduled Monuments\n\nIn total, 84.9% of all Scheduled Monuments with archaeological assessments are considered as being in optimal or generally satisfactory condition, whereas 12.4% are considered as either being in a generally unsatisfactory condition or having extensive significant problems.

Ambitious reductions in water consumption and leakage have a significant role in maintaining secure supplies and protecting the environment. This indicator shows changes in the efficient use of water, focussing on (a) leakage and (b) per capita consumption. Leakage and per capita household consumption of water in England are existing metrics reported to The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and the Environment Agency.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nWater companies in England and Wales report total leakage and per capita household consumption figures annually as 3-year moving averages, but it should be noted that these totals differ from the England-only data presented in this indicator due to the inclusion of results for Wales. From 2020, water companies report their leakage performance against Ofwat’s 2025 target, this is a 3-year average with 2017 to 2018 as a start point for the 3-year average.\n\nTrend description for Figures E8a and E8b\n\nE8a) Water leakage\n\nBetween 2018 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021, total water leakage in England averaged 2,857 megalitres per day, 9% lower than the daily average for the 3 years from 2000-2001 to 2002-2003.\n\nE8b) Per capita water consumption\n\nPer capita household water consumption has also fallen during the time period covered by this indicator, from an average of 152 litres per person per day in the 3 years to 2003/2004 to an average of 145 litres per person per day in the most recent 3-year time period (2018/2019 to 2020/2021).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for water leakage in England (E8a) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (3-year moving average time periods ending 2015/2016 to 2020/2021).

This represents a valuable output from the land and other resources used. Volume of agricultural production is considered to be a provisioning service provided by a range of natural capital assets (land, water, air, species and ecological communities). This indicator shows annual changes in the index of output volume which provides an overall measure of total production across the wide range of agricultural commodities. The index is calculated using agreed international standards. Farm practices and the use of inputs (particularly fertilisers and pesticides) directly influence the environmental pressures from farming including the quality, composition and availability of habitats and impact on air, water and soils. This indicator should therefore be viewed alongside indicator ‘E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production’ and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the volume of agricultural production in the UK. Data on total factor productivity for England by farm type are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\nTrend description for Figure E2\n\nAfter a period of sustained increase from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s the overall volume of agricultural production (outputs) in the UK has remained relatively stable, with some variation from year to year. Annual variations are generally driven by external factors, in particular weather, affecting growing and harvest and the variation in cropping driven by prices. Over the most recent year (2020), the overall volume of agricultural production in the UK fell by 5.7%; this was driven by a 14.1% decrease in total volume of crop output, a 0.8% decrease in the output volume of livestock for meat, and a 0.5% decrease in the output volume of livestock products.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nAn increase in volume of agricultural production has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and in the medium and long term. It is not possible to categorise this increase as either a simplistic ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’ as this will depend on numerous factors around farming practices. This indicator is included in the Outcome Indicator Framework to help interpret the reasons behind changes in ‘E4 Efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity’, rather than to assess progress for a policy driver in the 25 Year Environment Plan.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in volume of agricultural production since 2018, based on 3 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

The indicator combines data on the intensity and distribution of pressures from human activities with data on the distribution and sensitivity of seabed habitats. Data from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) showing fishing activity are linked to vessel logbook information and processed to create a layer showing abrasion pressure on the seabed. A second layer is produced by combining data on distribution of seabed habitats with information on resilience and resistance to evaluate their sensitivity to the pressure. The pressure and sensitivity layers are combined using a spatial method to create a single data layer showing the area of seabed subject to high disturbance from human activity. This indicator is linked to the ’Extent of Physical Damage to Predominant and Special Habitats’ indicator, developed for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and used for the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form as some changes to the method are needed to include additional activities and improve habitat sensitivity assessment. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the predicted area of seabed in the UK Continental Shelf exposed to disturbance from bottom contact fishing by vessels over 12m long. The assessments used for this interim indicator, including data and analytical methods, have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019). Inclusion of other human activities, specifically commercial aggregate extraction and improved sensitivity information are in development and will be available as part of the OSPAR Quality Status Report in 2023. Further long-term developments to this indicator will include assessments of new activities associated with localised disturbance pressure and higher resolution fishing data, including small fishing vessels under 12m (as data become available).\n\nNote on Figures C2i and C2ii\n\nThe degree of disturbance of a habitat is an index based on the predicted spatial and temporal overlap of its sensitivity and exposure to a specific pressure. Sensitivity is assessed using the distribution of habitats and information on species presence collected across the reporting cycle (2010 to 2015). The annual values of the distribution and intensity of pressure are aggregated to give an average pressure intensity for reporting cycle. If the pressure intensity is highly variable across the 6-year period in an area the highest value is taken. Sensitivity and pressure are combined via a matrix, producing 10 categories of disturbance ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 9 (greatest disturbance possible).\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the physical damage to benthic (seafloor) habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nA lack of data relating to the activities of smaller fishing vessels (less than 12m) exists as they are not currently equipped with a VMS recorder. Consequently, there is an underestimate of disturbance in inshore waters. Due to the analytical methods used in the production of fishing pressure layers, there is a potential overestimate of disturbance as a consequence of assuming an even distribution of fishing pressures.\n\nTrend description for Figures C2i and C2ii\n\nThere is currently no trend assessment due to constraints of current data availability. In future updates, changes over time might be identified by comparing results from multiple reporting cycle assessments such those produced by the UK Marine Strategy every 6 years. Future assessments will enable any trends to be identified, for example the number of regions achieving GES.\n\nThe results from 2010 to 2015 show pressure and disturbance caused by fishing activities to be widespread, occurring to some degree in 57% of the cells within UK waters. The charts show the aggregated values for seafloor disturbance from bottom fishing for the period 2010 to 2015. The highest level of disturbance is found in the English Channel and Southern Celtic Seas with 75% of both these areas being subject to high disturbance (categories 5 to 9). The extent of disturbance in the Northern North Sea and Southern North Sea is lower, 50% and 48% respectively, but still considerably above the target figure for GES. Within each assessment area there are grid cells showing no disturbance or low disturbance (categories 0 to 4), such as some central areas of the Northern North Sea. The Wider Atlantic (OSPAR Region V) was the only region to achieve GES over the assessment period 2010 to 2015 with 12% of its area subjected to high disturbance from bottom contact fishing.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","id":"3.2.1"},"/1-2-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/1-2-1","title":"Indicator 1.2.1 - Emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator tracks the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural resources as described in the Clean Growth Strategy. GHGs contribute to global climate change which is a pressure on many aspects of our environment. The indicator shows the annual net amount of GHG emissions from land use and land use change, forestry, agriculture, and waste sectors and from the use of fluorinated gases. It measures GHG emissions on a ‘territorial’ basis, which means that only emissions occurring within England’s borders are included.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nUnderlying data are published annually in the Greenhouse Gas Inventories 1990 to 2019. Additional information is also published annually in UK Spatial Emissions Methodology 2019 and mapping of the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory sectors to the sectors used in this indicator is available in the Net Zero Strategy: emissions taxonomy.\n\nNote on Figure A2\n\nThe data in this indicator are reflective of the current definition for GHGs from natural resources, they may be subject to change in future updates.\n\nThe whole time series is revised annually to take account of any methodological improvements, reflect the latest data, and follow the latest international guidelines. Two revisions in particular have had a marked impact on the 2022 update of this indicator:\n\nFirst, methodologies for wetlands from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2013 supplement to the 2006 IPCC guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands’ have been implemented in the 1990 to 2019 Greenhouse Gas Inventory to better represent emissions from drained and rewetted inland organic soils (peatlands). This has increased emissions estimates predominantly in the land use and land use change category. Including the impact of other changes as well, land use and land use change emissions estimates in England have increased overall by around 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) each year from 1990 to 2018 compared with figures published last year.\n\nSecond, a new UK-specific version of ‘HFC Outlook’, a model previously developed to support the UN Environment Programme and European partnership for Energy and Environment has also been implemented in the 1990 to 2019 Greenhouse Gas Inventory to better represent emissions from Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heat Pumps included within the fluorinated gases category.\n\nFurther details on both these and other revisions can be found in the 2019 UK greenhouse gas emissions: final figures - statistical release.\n\nTrend description for Figure A2\n\nAfter a small initial increase, net emissions of GHGs from natural resources in England have fallen by 50%, from 111 MtCO2e in 1990 to 56 MtCO2e in 2019. Net GHG emissions have fallen from all sectors included within this indicator; however, the greatest reduction has been achieved in the waste sector (38 MtCO2e or 71%). While net emissions from land use and land use change, and emissions from fluorinated gases and agriculture have fallen by 33%, 33% and 16% respectively, and net removals by the forestry sector have increased by 14%, the total net improvements in these 4 sectors combined (17 MtCO2e) is less than half of that achieved in the waste sector. More recently, for example, in the latest 10 years, emissions of GHGs from the waste sector and net emissions from land use and land use change have continued to fall, whereas net removals by the forestry sector and emissions from agriculture have fluctuated but show little overall change between 2009 and 2019. Emissions from fluorinated gases have increased by 10% since 2009.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nA decrease (or improvement) in emissions of GHGs from natural resources has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as in the medium and long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in emissions of GHGs from natural resources since 2018. However, this is based on 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

This indicator will show how the number of invasive non-native species entering Great Britain has been abated (reduced) by comparing a predicted trend for establishment of invasive non-native species against actual establishment. Establishment of invasive species depends on factors such as trade and climate change. The difference to the trend in actual establishment then provides a measure of the success of biosecurity measures.\n\nThe indicator will draw on data from the Non-Native Species Information Portal, overseen by the ‘Great Britain Non-Native Species Secretariat’, which maintains an early detection, surveillance and monitoring mechanism that facilitates management, including rapid response. This indicator requires significant development, including deciding on which species to include and establishing a baseline for the predicted and established trend.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form.

These data are published annually as UK Biodiversity Indicator B6 – Pressure from invasive species. Further development is required to compare these data against a predicted trend.\n\nNote on Figure H1\n\nThere are 3,248 non-native species in Great Britain, 2,016 of which are classified as established (reproducing in the wild). This indicator contains 194 non-native species that are considered to be exerting a negative impact on native biodiversity (47 freshwater species, 39 marine species and 108 terrestrial species). The majority (187) of these species are established; 6 are long-term residents but not known to breed in the wild.\n\nTrend description for Figure H1\n\nBetween the period 1960 to 1969 and the year 2020, the number of invasive non-native species established in or along 10% or more of Great Britain’s land area or coastline has increased in the freshwater, terrestrial and marine (coastal) environments, with the greatest increases in numbers having been observed in the marine and terrestrial environments.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThe H1 indicator ‘Abatement of the number of invasive non-native species entering and establishing against a baseline’ reports one cumulative data point for each 10-year period included within the indicator, unlike the majority of other indicators that report annually. Therefore, it is only possible to assess long-term trends as there are insufficient data points to establish trends over shorter time periods. An increase (or deterioration) was observed over the long term for freshwater, marine and terrestrial non-native species.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

These also affect the wildlife and ecology of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.\n\nData will be derived from the existing Riverine Input and Direct Discharges (RID) data collected under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and the Environment Agency’s Emissions Inventory.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows relative changes in measured riverine loads (inputs) of selected metals and nutrients into English tidal waters between 2008 and 2019, covering cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, zinc, nitrogen and ortho-phosphate. Some data for this interim indicator have previously been published as part of the OSPAR assessments (Inputs of Mercury, Cadmium and Lead via Water and Air to the Greater North Sea) although for different time periods and so these data should be compared with caution.\n\nFurther development is required to present statistical trends for the selected contaminants in an indicator. These data are taken from the existing OSPAR database. The Environment Agency reports a subset of these data to Defra on an annual basis known as the RIDS dataset, ‘Riverine and Industrial Discharges’.\n\nContact the Environment Agency’s National Customer Contact Centre (enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk) for the OSPAR database extract used for the interim indicator.\n\nNote on Figures B1a and B1b\n\nData collection for this interim indicator was heavily impacted by adherence to the government’s COVID-19 restrictions during the pandemic. In total, only 357 samples were taken and analysed in 2020 compared with 1,237 samples in 2019. In addition, all the samples for 2020 were taken during wetter months with high flow rates (306 in January to March and 51 in October to December); no samples were collected in the period April to September. Therefore, the summary data for 2020 are unlikely to be representative of the true levels of riverine inputs into English tidal waters and are not reported in this indicator.\n\nLoad (input) calculations (kg per day) are the product of the monitored concentration of substance and flow rate. The annual total loads (kg per year) for selected metals (total fraction), total nitrogen and ortho-phosphate are calculated using chemical concentration data reported in the Water quality data Archive and flow data reported in the Environment Agency’s core system of hydrometric and hydrological values (Water Information System by Kisters).\n\nFigures B1a and B1b show each annual load relative to the 2008 monitored load (2008 is represented as a baseline index = 100). Observed fluctuations in the data could be influenced by a number of external factors affecting movement and loading within river systems. These factors include flow caused by high or low rainfall in a given year and local impacts of changing industry or land use over time. There appears to be a relationship between high flows and high loads, and it should also be noted that the baseline year of 2008 saw high flows.\n\nTrend description for Figures B1a and B1b\n\nB1a) Riverine inputs of selected metals\n\nRiverine inputs of cadmium, copper, lead, mercury and zinc into English tidal waters have fluctuated considerably between 2008 and 2019, but overall, they have all fallen. Measured loads of cadmium, mercury, copper, zinc and lead were 49%, 45%, 41% 32% and 21% respectively less in 2019 than they were in 2008.\n\nB1b) Riverine inputs of selected nutrients\n\nRiverine inputs of total nitrogen and ortho-phosphate have also fluctuated considerably between 2008 and 2019, but overall, both have fallen, and both have remained below their baseline value with measured loads in 2019 being 41% and 49% respectively less than those measured in 2008.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as further development is required to present statistical trends for the selected contaminants in an indicator.\n","id":"2.1.1"},"/7-4-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/7-4-1","title":"Indicator 7.4.1 - Engagement with the natural environment","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator will track changes in people’s engagement with the natural environment. It is our objective that, alongside improvements in natural environments, people are also engaging more with them. Spending time in the natural environment is important for both human health and wellbeing, and increasing pro-environmental behaviours to support nature recovery.\n\nA range of measurements may be indicative of engagement with the natural environment, but for the purposes of this indicator, data covering the broadest possible aspects of nature and engagement are considered. In addition, other measures of engagement relating to people’s care and concern for the environment are measured as part of indicators ‘G5 People engaged in social action for the environment’ and ‘G6 Environmental attitudes and behaviours’.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form.

However, data from 2020/2021 show that 71% of adults said they had visited green and natural spaces at least once a week (11% once or twice a month, 14% less than once a month, and 4% never did this).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThis year’s Outcome Indicator Framework report presents a baseline year of data on frequency of visits to the natural environment from PANS. When a sufficient time series is available, we will use this new indicator for the assessment of change. In the meantime, trends in the historic data from the MENE survey have been assessed. The time series for the MENE indicator on frequency of visits to the natural environment is not long enough to produce an assessment for medium and long-term time periods. An increase (or improvement) was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018).\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. An increase (or improvement) in frequency of visits to the natural environment was observed since 2018 (up to 2019).

The indicator will have 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those widespread species for which relevant data are available; and (b) changes in the distribution (the number of 1km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of widespread species for which relevant data are available.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the abundance of (a) breeding wild birds, (b) widespread butterflies and (c) widespread bats in England. The expectation is that this indicator will be expanded to include more species groups and habitat types in the future. Some data are already published annually elsewhere (wild birds, butterflies on farmland and in woodland, and bats), and methods for analysing trends in plants are being developed. Further work is required to combine and present trends for different species groups and habitat types within the abundance and distribution measures in this indicator.\n\nNote on Figures D4ai, D4aii, D4bi, D4bii and D4c\n\nDue to COVID-19 restrictions in England, the latest Breeding Bird Survey report prepared by the British Trust for Ornithology, the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee collected limited data in 2020 and therefore it was not possible to update the indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England either here or in the source publication.\n\nTrend description for Figures D4ai, D4aii, D4bi, D4bii and D4c\n\nWhilst the following overall trends are clear from the charts, they mask the trends for individual species within each index – some farmland and woodland species trends have increased whereas others have either remained the same or decreased over time. Further details on these individual species trends are available in the source publications.\n\nD4a) Breeding wild birds\n\nThe indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England have both declined between 1970 and 2019; the former by almost 30%, the latter by 60%. Farmland birds experienced steeper declines during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s because of rapid changes in farmland management.\n\nD4b) Widespread butterflies\n\nThe indicators for widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland in England also declined between 1990 and 2010, the former more steeply than the latter. However, in recent years, the woodland butterfly indicator has shown little change while the farmland butterfly indicator has increased to a figure similar to its 1990 baseline value.\n\nD4c) Widespread bats\n\nThe indicator for widespread bats in England has increased by approximately 40% since the turn of the century. The bat species within this index vary in their habitat requirements, but all occur in farmland and woodland landscapes.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nIndicators for breeding wild birds, widespread butterflies and widespread bats in England are also reported in the England Biodiversity Indicators, which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is tailored to the datasets of the specific taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies and bats) and factors-in information on confidence. The assessment found a decrease (or deterioration) in both breeding wild birds on farmland and woodland in England over the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There was little or no change in widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland over this period, and an increase (or improvement) in widespread bats. Over the long term, decreases in breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland, and widespread butterflies in woodland, were recorded. Widespread butterflies on farmland showed little or no change in the long term, while widespread bats increased.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. An assessment using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology was only available for butterflies for this time period. Little or no change was seen since 2018 for both widespread woodland and farmland butterflies. However, this is based on 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in sections 5 and 6 of the latest England Biodiversity Indicators report.

Chemical reactions in the air involving nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produce the toxic gas O3 which can harm health, damage wild plants, crops, forests, and some materials, and is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as a pressure on human health and thriving plants and wildlife. It is determined by calculating the annual average of the maximum daily 8-hour mean concentrations of O3 measured at all rural measurement sites on Defra’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on concentrations of ozone are published annually as National Statistics, Air Quality Statistics.\n\nTrend description for Figure A4\n\nThe average daily maximum 8 hour mean concentration of O3 has fluctuated since the beginning of the time series in 1987.

The assessments of marine mammals will be based on trends in the abundance of harbour seals; Atlantic grey seal pup production; and the abundance of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). The assessments of marine birds will be based on the proportion of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds that have met abundance targets, which were set to inform progress towards Good Environmental Status (GES). The GES assessments of marine mammals and birds were used in the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form as some further development is being undertaken. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (a) changes in the abundance of harbour seals and the production of Atlantic grey seal pups in the north-east and south-east of England, and (b) changes in the abundance of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas (OSPAR marine regions including data from neighbouring countries). The assessments of seals and marine birds used for this interim indicator have been reported at a UK scale under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019). The assessment for seals used data from 1994 to 2014, whereas the most recent data on seals presented in Figures C3ai and C3aii are published by the Special Committee on Seals (SCOS). The indicator will be kept under review during the development of ‘D5 Conservation status of our native species’ as some elements of this indicator may ultimately be included in D5 instead. Cetaceans are not yet included in this indicator, but they will be once more definitive assessments can be made. Whale and dolphin species were assessed in the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) using data on abundance. However, for most species, trends in abundance could not be determined because there were an insufficient number of population estimates.\n\nNote on Figures C3ai, C3aii, C3bi and C3bii\n\nWhile the data currently available for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in this interim indicator predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of changes in GES of marine birds. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTargets for GES were met if harbour seal abundance and Atlantic grey seal pup production: a) declined by less than an average of 1% per year during 2009 to 2014, or b) decreased by less than 25% since the baseline year (1992 or start of time series, if later). The UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) GES assessment for seals covered the Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea. No data are available for harbour seal abundance in north-east England for the years 2020 and 2021 as COVID-19 related travel and working restrictions prevented aerial surveys of most harbour seal sites in these years.\n\nGES is achieved for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds if 75% or more species meet or exceed their thresholds for relative abundance (the dashed horizontal line on Figures C3bi and C3bii). The relative abundance of a species is the annual abundance expressed as a proportion of the baseline, which was taken as the abundance at the start of the timeseries in 1992. Thresholds for relative abundance were set to define GES: greater than 80% of the baseline for species that lay one egg and greater than 70% of the baseline for species that lay more than one egg.\n\nTrend description for Figures C3ai, C3aii, C3bi and C3bii\n\nC3a) Seals\n\nTrends in harbour seal numbers in eastern England had been largely positive since the mid-1990s, although they appear to have levelled off and then fallen between 2015 and 2021. In the south-east, where the majority of the England population are found, numbers have fluctuated showing an increase from 2,793 in 1995 to 4,944 in 2018 followed by a sharp decline to 3,752 in 2019, corresponding to a reduction of 25%. Since 2019, numbers have continued to decline at a slower rate reaching a value of 3,505 in the latest survey conducted in 2021. Numbers are much lower in north-east England; they have shown a steady increase from 45 animals in 1994 to 91 in 2015 before declining to 79 in 2019. The UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1994 to 2014 concluded that because of declines in Scotland, GES had not been achieved for harbour seal abundance in the UK Greater North Sea sub-region (which includes seal populations in the north-east and south-east of England).\n\nIn south-east England annual Atlantic grey seal pup production has risen exponentially from just 200 pups in 1992 to 7,902 pups in 2019. In north-east England the rise in pup production has been steadier, from 985 pups in 1992 to 2,823 in 2019. The UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1992 to 2014 concluded that GES for Atlantic grey seals has been achieved in the Greater North Sea.\n\nC3b) Marine birds\n\nThe proportion of seabird species meeting thresholds for breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas has remained stable since 2012 but remains below the 75% target (59% in the Greater North Sea in 2014 and 63% in the Celtic Seas in 2015). The UK Marine Strategy (2019) assessment concluded GES for breeding seabirds has not been achieved in the Greater North Sea or Celtic Seas.\n\nThe proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds for non-breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea has declined sharply but was still on target in 2013 to 2014 (78%); the proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds in the Celtic Seas has also declined sharply (53% in 2014 to 2015) and has remained below target since 2006. GES for non-breeding (wintering) waterbirds has been achieved in the Greater North Sea but not in the Celtic Seas.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nAn increase (or improvement) in the abundance of harbour seals in both the north-east and south-east of England was observed in the medium and long term. Increases were also found in the north-east over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018). A decrease (deterioration) in harbour seal abundance was found in the south-east over most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed but note the different data range this applies to (2015 to 2020) and that harbour seals are present in much higher numbers in the south-east. An increase (or improvement) in grey seal pup production was found in both regions over most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as over the medium and long term. These overall trends were assessed using smoothed data do not pick up on small scale patterns in abundance.\n\nIn the Greater North Sea, little or no change was observed in the percentage of breeding seabirds or wintering waterbirds meeting abundance targets for GES over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2008 to 2013). In the Celtic Seas, there was also little or no change for breeding seabirds over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2009 to 2014), but the percentage of wintering waterbirds meeting abundance targets decreased (a deterioration). There has been a decrease in all 4 indicators for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds over the medium and long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there was little or no change in harbour seal abundance in the north-east, and a decrease in the south-east. An increase in grey seal pup production was found in both regions. However, this is based on less than 5 data points (2 for the north-east and 4 for the south-east) so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend. No data are available after 2018 for assessing bird indicators.\n\nThis assessment does not consider whether any improvements are on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. The assessment results reported here are not directly comparable with other analyses published elsewhere that use different methodologies to explore these indicators or are based on alternative datasets.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Preventing the spread of invasive non-native species limits their ability to disrupt ecosystems and cause economic damage. Plant pests and diseases cause significant negative impacts and it is often more difficult to prevent their entry and establishment, therefore limiting spread is critical in preventing negative impact on native species and ecosystems. This indicator will utilise distribution data for a reference subset of priority invasive species and plant pests and diseases as an indication of the success of biosecurity measures in controlling their spread.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England since the year 2000. These data are published in the Forestry Commission’s Key Performance Indicators Reports. Further development is required to identify species for inclusion and develop the indicator drawing on existing data.\n\nNote on Figure H2\n\nThis indicator enumerates those additional tree pests and diseases formally considered as becoming ‘established’ by the UK Plant Health Risk Group within a rolling 10-year period. Establishment is defined as ‘perpetuation, for the foreseeable future, of a pest within an area after entry’. This is the definition produced by the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention.\n\nIt is not possible to sum the number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established within each 10-year period to calculate the total number becoming established since 2000. This is because each tree pest or disease is included in up to 10 rolling 10-year time periods; adding them together would result in a greatly inflated total for the time period covered by this indicator.\n\nTrend description for Figure H2\n\nThe number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England within a rolling 10-year period fell from a peak of 7 in 2000-2009 to a low of 3 in 2007-2016. It subsequently increased again to 5 in 2009-2018 before falling to 4 in 2010-2019 and 2011-2020 (the 2 most recent 10-year periods for which data are available). In total, 11 tree pests and diseases became established in England in the 20 years from 2000 to 2020 and of these, the 4 ‘established’ between 2011 and 2020 are:\n\n\n  Chalara dieback of Ash (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus), considered established in 2012.\n  Oriental chestnut gall wasp (Dryocosmus kuriphilus), considered established in 2016.\n  Sweet chestnut blight caused by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, considered established in 2017.\n  The Elm zigzag sawfly (Aproceros leucopoda), considered established in 2018, following a rapid expansion across Europe from eastern Asia\n\n\nAssessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the interim indicator for H2 Number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (10-year rolling time periods ending 2015 and 2020). However, there has been a decrease (improvement) over the medium and long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been a decrease in number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

In addition, labour and land is required as well as depreciation of capital. Minimising the use of these inputs is an important policy driver to improve productivity and hence improve profitability whilst reducing the environmental impacts of farming. Farm practices and the use of inputs (particularly fertilisers and pesticides) directly influence the environmental pressures from farming including the quality, composition and availability of habitats and impact on air, water and soils. Volume of inputs may therefore be considered an indirect measure of pressure on a range of natural capital assets.\n\nThis indicator should be viewed alongside indicator ‘E2 Volume of agricultural production’ and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets. The index of the volume of inputs is an overall measure of the total inputs used with price effects removed. This includes all inputs including intermediate consumption, land, labour and depreciation of capital.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK.\n\nData on total factor productivity for England by farm type are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\nTrend description for Figure E3\n\nThe volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK has shown an overall decline since 1973. Most of this decline took place between the late 1990s and 2006; since then, there has been a slight increase in the volume of inputs used in agricultural production, but the volume remains below historical levels. Over the most recent year (2020), the volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK fell slightly (by 1.2%).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nAn increase in volume of inputs used in agricultural production has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and in the medium term. This is in contrast to long-term decreasing trends. It is not possible to simplistically categorise these changes as either an ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’ for the environment as this will depend on the types of input driving change. An increase in inputs of pesticide and fertiliser would likely have a negative effect, but this indicator also includes other inputs such as labour. This indicator is included in the Outcome Indicator Framework to help interpret the reasons behind changes in ‘E4 Efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity’.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in volume of inputs used in agricultural production since 2018, based on 3 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

The indicator is derived from assessments of individual stocks. Where available, the assessment of stocks against their Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) will be incorporated into the overall indicator. The indicator is linked to UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 3 (Commercial Fish and Shellfish) and the Convention on Biological Diversity sustainable fisheries indicators and is derived from International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and national stock assessments.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. A revised interim indicator is presented here that shows: the percentage of stocks of UK interest fished at or below the level capable of producing MSY (FMSY); and the percentage of stocks with spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the level capable of producing MSY (MSY Btrigger). The revised indicator also introduces a new upper limit (Fupper, where available) for a number of stocks that are fished above FMSY, but within an acceptable mortality range (in FMSY range) as defined by internationally agreed Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs) for fisheries. In addition, a lower limit reference point (Blim) is included for SSB to distinguish a number of stocks that are at a higher risk of reproductive impairment, from those that are at lower risk (that is, above Blim but below MSY Btrigger).\n\nThe assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) using data from 1990 to 2015 for FMSY and from1990 to 2016 for MSY Btrigger. Data on commercially exploited fish and shellfish, analytical methods and assessment are available. Data are also published annually in the UK Biodiversity Indicator B2 – Sustainable fisheries. National shellfish stocks assessments are updated on a 3-year cycle. These data are not included in the interim indicator but were published as part of the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) and will be included in the final indicator. Once population age and size distribution assessments are developed, they will be included to provide further detail for this indicator.\n\nTrend description for Figures C10a and C10b\n\nOverall, there is evidence of a positive trend towards a greater proportion of stocks fished sustainably in both the long term and in recent years. There is also a positive trend for fish stocks remaining within safe biological limits in the long term, but a negative trend in recent years. For both measures, there is a decreasing percentage of stocks with unknown status, from almost 50% in 1990 to 23% in 2019.\n\nC10a) Marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest harvested sustainably\n\nThe percentage of fish stocks (including Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus) fished at or below FMSY, and/or within acceptable mortality range levels, has increased from 9% in 1990 to 51% in 2019. The percentage fished above FMSY has decreased over the same time period, from 42% of UK quota-fish stocks assessed being fished at levels of fishing pressure above FMSY in 1990 to 26% in 2019.\n\nC10b) Marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity\n\nTo maintain the reproductive capacity of stocks, each stock’s spawning biomass (SSB) should be at or above the level capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (that is, MSY Btrigger). The percentage of stocks subject to quota management and achieving this goal has increased from 30% in 1990 to 58% in 2019. A further 4% of stocks were at low risk of reproductive impairment (that is, with a SSB below MSY Btrigger but above Blim) in 2019 and 16% more were at high risk of reproductive impairment (that is, with SSB below MSY Btrigger and Blim).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nTwo indicator components are assessed here: ‘marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest harvested sustainably’ and ‘marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity’. Assessments of change are made for the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2012 to 2017), as well as medium and long-term periods. In every case there has been an improvement recorded.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Marine fish harvested sustainably decreased (a deterioration) in 2019 while there was little or no change in marine fish stocks with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity. However, this is based on two data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nThe assessment results reported here are not directly comparable with other analyses published elsewhere that use different methodologies to explore these indicator components.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. The main sources of PM2.5 pollution are industrial processes, combustion in residential, public, commercial, and agricultural sectors and road transport.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the annual population-weighted mean concentration of PM2.5 in the air, assessed as background concentrations per 1km square. The population-weighted mean concentration is used as a measure of the impact of PM2.5 on the health of the total population. Greater weighting is given to concentrations of PM2.5 in urban areas to reflect the higher population density as those concentrations will affect a greater number of people. In addition, people living in urban areas are generally exposed to greater levels of PM2.5 than those living in rural areas.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are published annually at UK Air Information Resource, Modelled background pollution data.\n\nNote on Figure A3\n\nPM2.5 annual mean concentrations are estimated annually for every square kilometre of the UK through the Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) model. The geographical distribution of the UK population is then joined to the estimated concentrations to estimate the annual mean concentration of PM2.5, weighted on where the population lives. This enables us to account for most of the population living in densely populated urban areas, where concentrations are likely to be greatest.\n\nTrend description for Figure A3\n\nPopulation-weighted annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in England have declined from 12.1μg per m3 in 2011 to 7.5μg per m3 in 2020, a fall of 38% over the latest 9 years for which data are available.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nConcentrations of PM2.5 decreased (an improvement) over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019). The time series is not yet long enough to make a trend assessment for the medium and long-term time periods. This assessment does not consider whether improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting any targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed where possible. A decrease in concentrations of fine particulate matter was also observed since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

Plants, fungi, algae, invertebrates and soil micro-organisms are particularly important. The presence, abundance and diversity of species are key factors in determining the resilience of ecosystems to environmental changes, including climate change and disease, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. Further research is required to develop this indicator, building on the existing UK pollinator indicator and defining species groups and functions for inclusion.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form, and there were no new data available to update this interim form of the indicator this year. This interim indicator shows trends in the distribution (occupancy of 1km grid squares) of pollinators (bees and hoverflies) in the UK. These data are published annually as UK Biodiversity Indicator D1c – Status of pollinating insects. Significant further research and development is required to include a range of species groups important for supporting ecosystem functions in England.\n\nTrend description for Figures D7i and D7ii\n\nThere was an overall decrease in the UK pollinators index from 1987 onwards. In 2017, the index had declined by 30% compared to its value in 1980. More recently however, this downward trend has slowed, with the indicator decreasing by less than 2% between 2012 and 2017. These overall declines mask the trends of the individual species within the index, 49% of which have become less widespread, 19% of which have become more widespread and 32% of which have shown little or no change since the index began in 1980. By contrast, over the short term (between 2012 and 2017), a slightly greater proportion of species have become more widespread (46%) than have become less widespread (43%).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThe indicator ‘Change in the distribution of pollinators in the UK’ is also reported in the England Biodiversity Indicators, which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is more tailored to the specific dataset and factors-in information on confidence. No results were available for the medium-term period using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology, although this will be considered for the next publication. The assessment found little or no change in the distribution of pollinators in the UK in the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There was a long-term decrease (or deterioration).\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in section 10 of the latest England Biodiversity Indicators report.

As well as being vital for food production, agriculture helps to shape the landscape, providing important recreational, spiritual and other cultural benefits. This indicator shows annual changes in land used for agriculture in 3 categories: grassland (including sole rough grazing); crops (including horticulture and perennial crops); and uncropped arable (land left fallow or under environmental management). Agricultural production and the associated land use and management are key drivers of the environmental impacts from the sector. A key policy challenge is to de-couple production from environmental impact. The indicator may be considered a measure of pressure on the environment, a measure of condition of the land asset, or a measure of service/benefit we derive from the land. The indicator is included in the framework to provide contextual information.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nData on the structure of the agricultural industry in England are already published annually as National Statistics.\n\nTrend description for Figure E1\n\nAfter a period of decline in the late 1980s, land use by agriculture has remained relatively stable. Similarly, the split between crops and grazing has remained relatively constant over this time, with grassland accounting for around half of agricultural land (51% in 2021) and crops a little under half (46% in 2021).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for area of agricultural land over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020) and in the medium term. There has been a decrease in the long term since 1984. It is not possible to categorise this decrease as either an ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’. Whether a change away from agricultural land is positive for the environment will depend on numerous factors such as the farming practices that were employed and what the new land use is.\n\nChange since the start of the 25 Year Environment Plan has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in area of agricultural land since 2018, based on 4 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the Assessment background page.

The indicator is based on multi regional input-output (MRIO) modelling, which is used to model global trade flows representing the monetary inputs and outputs across different countries and their commercial sectors. While the indicator is also based on a similar concept and approach to ‘J1 Carbon footprint and consumer buying choices’ and ‘J2 Raw material consumption,’ the detail of the methodologies does not align and therefore the results are not directly comparable.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (i) the global deforestation risk and (ii) the global ‘scarcity-weighted blue water use’ from UK consumption of imported commodities; a further metric to measure biodiversity loss is currently being developed. The figures are calculated using the Input-Output Trade Analysis (IOTA) framework and the results are reported for the first time in 2022 as an experimental statistic; information on how the data have been obtained and how the statistics have been calculated is available in UK Biodiversity Indicator A4 – Global biodiversity impacts of UK economic activity and sustainable consumption. The data are being published as experimental statistics, both here and within the source publication, to gather feedback and facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator. An early metric for measuring biodiversity loss is included within UK Biodiversity Indicator A4 publication but is undergoing refinement before publication as part of the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n\nNote on Figures K1i and K1ii\n\nData that trace all commodities back to their exact countries of origin are not publicly available. This information is necessary in order to accurately link production to deforestation and water use. Therefore, the outputs produced by this indicator are derived from modelling these trade flows, and so (whilst based on empirical statistics) they should be considered as best estimates rather than exact figures. Additional caveats and limitations are outlined in the source publication – the Global biodiversity impacts of UK economic activity and sustainable consumption.\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTrend description for Figures K1i and K1ii\n\nK1i) Tropical deforestation\n\nUK consumption of crop, cattle-related and timber commodities in 2017 was responsible for an estimated 31,126 hectares of agriculture-driven tropical deforestation worldwide, a long-term decrease of 58% since the time series began in 2005. Comparing the 2017 footprint with 2012 reveals a short-term decrease of 41% and a decrease (6%) was also observed in the latest year (2017).\n\nK1ii) Blue water use\n\nUK consumption of crop commodities in 2017 was responsible for an estimated 367 billion cubic-meters of scarcity-weighted blue water use worldwide, a decrease of 48% since 2005. Comparing the 2017 footprint with 2012 reveals a 27% decrease, but there was very little change (1% increase) observed in the latest year (2017).\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThis indicator was not assessed as it is newly introduced this year and data were not available in time to allow for analysis to be carried out.

Data on Nominal and real regional gross value added (balance) by industry and Estimates of the population for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are published by the Office for National Statistics. This indicator, together with additional supporting methodology is also included within the Resources and waste strategy for England.\n\nTrend description for Figures J2a and J2b\n\nJ2a) Raw material consumption per capita\n\nThe average raw material footprint per capita in England (excluding fossil fuels) fell by 25.0% between 2001 and 2018. It peaked in 2004, decreased steadily until 2007 and then fell sharply during the 2008 to 2009 recession. It rose again until 2015 but has fallen over the latest 3 years for which data are available (2016 to 2018) to 11.8 tonnes per capita.

Firstly, a statistical database and spatially mapped monitoring of changes in landscape and waterscape character in National Character Areas (NCA) and protected landscapes across all of England. Secondly, monitoring at an England scale of the public’s perceptions of landscape character and how those perceptions relate to the landscape change trends being identified. Thirdly, findings will be informed by on-going monitoring (since 2013) of environmental outcomes in our protected landscapes (National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty).

Four Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data. The natural conditions required for seagrass beds to exist limits their occurrence in coastal water bodies.

It consists of 2 metrics. The first metric looks at the size of the fish in a community (Typical Length) and the second looks at the composition of fish communities (Mean Maximum Length). Together these metrics tell us about the health and status of fish communities. A healthy fish community will be made up of species in the expected ratio of numbers of individuals, and with individual species showing the age classes and sizes consistent with a healthy population. Typical Length: a reduction in the proportion of larger, older, fish (as measured by Typical Length) of several species, suggests the top (predator) level of the food web is in poor condition. Mean Maximum Length: if the species that tend towards larger individuals are depleted and smaller-bodied species become more abundant (shown by a reduction in Mean Maximum Length), the species composition of the community can change, suggesting prolonged periods of pressure. When the community is dominated by slow growing species (as expected at low Maximum Mean Length), the size structure is limited in its ability to recover (reduced Typical Length).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form.

They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTrend description for Figures C7a and C7b\n\nC7a) Typical Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities\n\nIn the English Channel, northern North Sea and the eastern Irish Sea, the health of the demersal fish community has improved since the 1990s, with an increasing contribution of large individuals (increasing Typical Length). In the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the proportion of individuals within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller fish (low Typical Length) indicating this community is in poorer health. In the northern North Sea, no change in the Typical Length in the pelagic fish community is evident. The Typical Length of pelagic fish generally shows no long-term change at the sub-regional level in the Celtic Seas.\n\nC7b) Mean Maximum Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities\n\nIn the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the balance of species within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller species (low Mean Maximum Length), indicating this community is in poorer health. There has been no long-term change in Mean Maximum Length of demersal fish communities in the northern North Sea. Within the southern and central North Sea, the Mean Maximum Length of pelagic fish communities is declining suggesting the proportion of larger species is declining. There is no long-term change in the Mean Maximum Length in the northern North Sea.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","id":"3.7.1"},"/3-9-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/3-9-1","title":"Indicator 3.9.1 - Healthy seas: seafloor habitats functioning","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator will show changes in the natural functionality and extent of seafloor habitats able to support a healthy and productive ecosystem. The indicator is linked to the UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 6 (Seafloor Integrity). The indicator will be derived from the integration of metrics of individual broad habitat types and selected vulnerable habitats. Well-functioning seafloor habitats (physically and structurally) are both productive and sufficiently extensive, to carry out natural functionality, including the necessary ecological processes which underpin ecosystem goods and services, and are capable of supporting a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for the long term.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 as further development and testing is required.

The indicator will focus on pelagic (water column) habitats and populations of key species groups within the food web. The indicator will also link to and complement C9 ‘Healthy seas: Seafloor habitats functioning’. These show whether ecosystems are healthy and are being used sustainably. Currently, the metrics within this indicator are being developed for the UK Marine Strategy Descriptors 1 (biodiversity), 4 (food webs) and 6 (seafloor integrity) and the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 as significant development is required. Research is underway to further develop the food web metrics that constitute this indicator. Analytical methods and some data on food webs are available.\n\nFunctional ‘feeding guilds’ based on diet and life stage have been defined for fish using a recently collated dataset of stomach contents for the North East Atlantic and its marginal seas (Thompson et al., 2020). These feeding guilds were applied to assess change in fisheries-independent survey data, revealing spatial aggregations of feeding guilds, and regions of change over time indicative of change in ecosystem structure and function. Ongoing developments include the collation of more stomach content data to further resolve predator diets. Stomach content data are publicly available from International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) Fish-stomach data portal (Fish stomach (ices.dk)) and the Cefas Integrated Database and Portal for Fish Stomach Records.

Data are currently available for representative chemicals in water and in certain species of birds of prey, fish, mammals, and mussels. Other relevant exposure data will be incorporated in the future. Further work is ongoing to improve reporting for exposure metrics and to understand better the effects of chemicals on wildlife populations and individuals.\n\nThis indicator is complementary to other indicators within the framework that give data on environmental pressures from chemicals, for example, ‘B1 Pollution loads entering waters’ and ‘H3 Emissions of mercury and persistent organic pollutants to the environment’.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. The interim indicator presented here is consistent with that published in 2021 as an experimental statistic. It covers the exposure of wildlife to chemicals in the environment and, where feasible, the risk from different types of chemicals to wildlife on land and in water. The indicator is based on chemical concentrations found in water and in different organisms – sparrowhawk/red kite, red fox (data extraction under development), freshwater fish, otter, blue mussel, dab, and harbour porpoise. It covers 3 environmental compartments: terrestrial, freshwater and marine (estuarine, coastal and offshore).\n\nThe chemicals are representative of 3 groups highlighted for attention under the 25 Year Environment Plan: persistent, bioaccumulative (the accumulation of a substance over time in a living organism) and toxic (PBT) substances, heavy metals, and pesticides and biocides. There are no new assessments to report in 2022, but we aim to update the indicator in 2024 as further data become available.\n\nThese data are being published as an experimental statistic to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator.\n\nWe would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via 25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk.\n\nFurther details on the data analysis used for the presented indicator are given in the supporting H4 indicator report. Some data relevant to this indicator are published: Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme – contaminant exposure, Water Quality Data Archive, Water quality monitoring gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry semi-quantitative screening data, British Oceanographic Data Centre - Monitoring and Assessment National Database (MERMAN).\n\nSince the publication of the H4 indicator report, we have been working to improve our understanding of exposure of wildlife to the chemical contaminants presented, including by analysis of archived samples to address data gaps and get a picture across environmental compartments. This will enhance our ability to report exposure trends. We are exploring methods for assessing chemical contaminant effects on wildlife to improve our understanding of environmental impacts and the potential to report these under the indicator.\n\nIn addition, we are initiating the development of metrics for emerging chemical risks. This includes integrating results from the Prioritisation and Early Warning System (PEWS) for chemicals of emerging concern, which was developed in response to the 25 Year Environment Plan to consolidate work on monitoring and horizon scanning. PEWS includes consideration of the risks posed by emerging contaminants to surface and groundwaters, biota, soils and sediments. The approach taken on emerging risks will also seek to incorporate the consideration of broader chemical topics which extend beyond PEWS.\n\nNote on Figure H4\n\nAvailable thresholds for wildlife have been used to provide context to the most-recent national concentrations. Their use to indicate risk does not represent a compliance assessment and should not be compared with other regulatory reporting regimes which may use values with different protection goals. The approach for selecting thresholds is specific to the wildlife or environmental medium being considered because of the data available and the purpose for which it was gathered. Monitoring networks and thresholds can change over time.\n\nThe freshwater assessment for pesticides is currently based on a threshold for short-term toxic effects. In the future, the approach will be adapted to reflect risks from chronic exposure.\n\nAdditional data are available for otter, freshwater fish and red fox which cannot be incorporated into the dashboard at present, but are provided in the supporting report to this indicator. The report also contains information on spatial variation in results for freshwater metals sites and for marine fish.\n\nTrend description for Figure H4\n\ni) PBT substances\n\nDownward trends are observed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in marine fish (dab) and for PBDEs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in harbour porpoise. These trends are particularly evident for PBDEs.\n\nExceedance of thresholds is most significant for mercury in the freshwater and marine environments, followed by PCBs in the marine environment. The result for mercury in dab may be over-precautionary for reasons given in supporting report.\n\nii) Heavy metals\n\nFor heavy metals, downward trends are observed for nickel and zinc in sparrowhawks, although the data are only available up to 2014. There is an upward trend for nickel in dab, which is driven by eastern and southern coastal marine sites.\n\nThe exceedance of the nickel threshold in estuarine and coastal waters is only driven by one site. Zinc shows the highest rate of threshold exceedance of the metals in both freshwater and estuarine and coastal waters.\n\nWhile the freshwater data for heavy metals show no change in concentrations from 2014 to 2019, these results can be split into 2 types: those for sites where the waters are affected by abandoned metal mines and those for sites in other locations. Cadmium and copper exhibit downward trends for the ‘other’ sites over the assessed time period. Lead, nickel and zinc concentrations show no statistically significant change over time at such sites. For waters affected by abandoned metal mines, none of the metals included within this indicator show any statistically significant change in concentrations over time. However, their elevated levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc mean that they comprise a high proportion of those overall sites above available thresholds. The exception is for nickel, where sites in ‘other’ locations comprise the majority of those at risk.\n\niii) Pesticides and biocides\n\nIt is not possible to assess trends currently for pesticides and second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs). Risk is indicated for less than a quarter of sites or individuals considered for pesticides in water and SGARs in red kite.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","id":"8.4.1"},"/8-5-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/8-5-1","title":"Indicator 8.5.1 - Exposure to transport noise","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator will track changes in the exposure of people to noise from transportation sources.

The network will build on the recommendations from ‘Making space for nature’, led by Professor Sir John Lawton, and will provide wider environmental benefits, including carbon capture and opportunities for recreation.\n\nData are available to measure some aspects of this indicator such as extent and condition of some habitats, but further work is required to assess habitats beyond protected sites, and reliable methods for measuring ecological connectivity need to be further tested. Some indicators of aspects of ecosystem functions and processes are available to assess condition, but these are not comprehensive. New methods of Earth Observation together with development of measures of favourable conservation status and long-term site-based monitoring offer good opportunities to develop this indicator.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022. Several elements of this indicator are published as England Biodiversity Indicators (for example, 2a – Extent and condition of priority habitats and 3 – Habitat connectivity in the wider countryside) but substantial further work is required to bring these elements together with new data to assess overall resilience. Ongoing work to progress this indicator includes the development of an earth observation approach (via the Living England project) for habitat quantity, statistical analysis of attributes to assess habitat quality and testing of different approaches to measure habitat connectivity.\n\nThe Living England project, led by Natural England, is a multi-year programme delivering a satellite-derived national habitat map.

The WRMPs, prepared, published and maintained in accordance with provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991 and regulations and directions made under it, must set out how a company intends to maintain the balance between supply and demand for water over at least the next 25 years. This includes how it will manage the increasing pressures on our water supplies from a growing population and climate change, whilst protecting the environment. Water company drought plans, also prepared, published and maintained under Water Industry Act 1991, set out the operational actions the water companies will take before, during and after a drought to maintain a secure supply of water.\n\nThis indicator will track changes in a Supply Demand Balance Index (SDBI), which will be reported by all water and sewerage companies from Summer 2022 as part of the Environment Agency’s Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA) report.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not ready for reporting in 2022.\n\nExisting Security of Supply Index (SoSi) data identifies whether water companies have a greater than planned risk of interruptions to public water supply during drought events.

Charts showing trends for individual indicators are useful to visualise how indicators have changed over time, but do not always simply show whether that change is occurring in a favourable direction aligned with policy ambitions.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework assessment aims to provide high level patterns for key environmental indicators to identify where there may be challenges of progress to date in achieving goals. This will support the targeting of further investigation to establish whether additional action is required. It can also highlight where there may be informative examples of success. The assessment is intended to be of value for key high-level messaging on environmental change.\n\nThere are limitations to the insights that can be gained from the Outcome Indicator Framework assessment alone. These indicators were originally selected to show change over time and were not designed to assess progress towards any specific targets. The results of this assessment show where improvements have been made, but supplementary analysis would be required to judge whether such improvements are occurring at a fast enough pace or large enough scale to meet specific targets.\n\nThe Environment Act 2021 creates a new statutory cycle of monitoring, planning and reporting on environmental improvement, based around a long-term Environmental Improvement Plan. The 25 Year Environment Plan is the first such Environmental Improvement Plan. Separately from the Outcome Indicator Framework update reports, government must report annually on what it has done to implement the Environmental Improvement Plan and on whether the natural environment (or particular aspects of it) has improved. That report will also consider the progress that has been made towards meeting targets.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework was designed to provide a robust account of changes in the environment. It was not designed to establish a causal link between an indicator’s observed trend and a specific driver of change (such as a policy intervention). Work to map indicator linkages for this assessment only highlights where indicators may be related. Further, detailed research would be required to prove the causes of any observed change in indicator trends.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework assessment shows changes which have already occurred, but it does not make any predictions about whether these changes are likely to continue into the future. The likelihood of such future trends will depend on a wide range of matters including environmental factors, policy interventions which are yet to take effect, and changes in human activity which may have associated environmental impacts. More elaborated modelling research would be required to make forward projections accounting for the likely effect of potential or planned interventions. Such a forward projection on an entire 25 Year Environment Plan scale is not a planned ambition of the Outcome Indicator Framework. Detailed forward projections are produced for some indicators in the framework. For example, projections of UK emissions of air quality pollutants are compiled by Defra to inform policy development and to enable comparison with international commitments.\n\nMethod\n\nData availability\n\nOf the 66 indicators currently included in the Outcome Indicator Framework, 16 are still in the process of being developed so could not be assessed at this point in time. Interim indicators were assessed in addition to final indicators as they can still offer useful insights. Some indicators currently show results for the latest year rather than a time series, reflecting current data availability of newly-developed indicators. As the assessment is based on trends, these could not be assessed. Some indicators do not yet have sufficient data points for a trend assessment across all time periods.\n\nData processing\n\nSome indicators have multiple components (different related metrics, or different variables such as various pollutants). Each indicator component was assessed separately to avoid masking important results through aggregation and to allow individual consideration.\n\nSome indicator components have a regular time series with a small number of irregular missing years of data. To allow trend assessment, missing years were extrapolated using the Excel fill function for a linear trend.\n\nMost indicator data were smoothed before undertaking trend assessments to reduce the influence of natural interannual variability. The need for smoothing is demonstrated clearly by the D4b indicator for widespread butterflies in woodland which presents both smoothed and unsmoothed data. The unsmoothed data fluctuates widely year by year as butterfly abundance is very susceptible to changes in weather. If the first or last data point in the assessed time period happen to be an unusually good or bad year, this will skew the percent change calculations. The smoothed values give users a more reliable indication of overall trend. A standard smoothing approach was adopted in most instances, as it is not practical to tailor smoothing for every indicator component individually. A Loess smoother was used as standard, as this is a versatile method suited to a wide variety of data.\n\nNote that smoothed data represent modelled values while unsmoothed data represent the original recorded values. If there is a large amount of fluctuation in the time series, the smoothed values may be quite different from the original values. This means percent change calculations based on smoothed data may also be quite different from what they would be if based on unsmoothed data. The decision on whether to use smoothed or unsmoothed data for individual indicator component assessments was made on a case by case basis, as deemed appropriate to suit the specific nature of the data series concerned.\n\nSome indicators already produce smoothed data using a different approach selected specifically for that dataset. Where available, these existing smoothed values were used in the Outcome Indicator Framework assessment for consistency in messaging. Where indicators present a rolling average, smoothing was not considered necessary and the final year in the rolling time period was assigned to that data point. Smoothing was also not undertaken where there was no natural variability or error expected in the data (for example, the protected area extent values shown in D2). Where smoothed data were used, the most recent data point was excluded before calculating percent change. Due to the smoothing process, the last data point in a series is often associated with greater error and deviates from the trendline to a greater degree, so including this more erratic value would lower confidence in the percent change calculation. This is consistent with the approach taken elsewhere for assessment of some of the UK Biodiversity Indicators.\n\nWhere possible, trend assessments were undertaken for 3 time periods: the most recent 5 years (short term), the most recent 10 years (medium term), and the whole time series (long term). Some indicators have regular monitoring undertaken less frequently than every year; in these cases, an assessment was undertaken if at least 3 data points were available within the assessed time period. To provide clarity, the date range covered by each time period is specified for each indicator component and it is noted whether the percent change values are based on smoothed or unsmoothed data.\n\nAn additional assessment was also undertaken to show change since 2018 (when the 25 Year Environment Plan was published) as this information is valuable for contextual consideration of environmental change. Data were treated slightly differently for this period as there were generally only 2 or 3 years of data available. The unsmoothed data were always used and the last year of data included, so some assessment could be undertaken for as many indicators as possible. This assessment gives some indication of changes since 2018 but is not a comparably robust trend assessment to the other time periods considered and results should be treated with caution.\n\nAssessment of change\n\nThe assessment of change is based on the percentage change seen over the assessed time period, along with the desired direction of change for moving towards environmental goals.\n\nFirst, it is established whether a ‘significant change’ has been observed. For most indicators, a threshold of at least 3% change (positive or negative) is used. This is consistent with the approach adopted for assessment of some of the UK Biodiversity Indicators and some other government assessments, such as Forestry Commission Key Performance Indicators. Where existing official Defra assessments were available for the same time periods using a more tailored methodology, these were replicated in the Outcome Indicator Framework assessment instead of applying the 3% threshold. The ‘little or no change’ category is intended to show indicators where any recorded change may be a result of random error in the dataset or due to chance, rather than a meaningful trend.\n\nIf a change has been observed, the direction of change is compared with the desired direction of change to assign a category of ‘improvement’ or ‘deterioration’. Some indicators do not have a desired direction of change (for example, E1 Area of agricultural land). These indicators may be provided for context to help understand other indicators, and additional information may be required to establish if an observed change is deemed to have a positive or negative connotation. Where a desired direction of change is not specified, indicators are assessed on whether change is significant.\n\nIndicator links\n\nA mapping exercise has been undertaken to show where indicators may be linked. Tables of potential links presented in the Summary of results section capture whether relationships between linked indicators are likely to be positive or negative and the rationale for including a link. The indicator mapping has been used to create network diagrams to highlight the interconnectivity between different environmental goals.\n\nIdentified indicator links are supported by text in the Outcome Indicator Framework itself, original indicator methods and assessment reports referenced in the ‘Readiness and links to data’ sections of indicator fiches, or any additional key references relating to individual indicator development provided by indicator leads. It was not deemed necessary for references to prove a statistical, causal link. Links simply show that the 2 indicators are likely to be related and it is possible a change in one may influence the results of the other. For the purposes of this exercise, there needed to be a direct link identified between specific indicators, not a chain of links culminating in an impact made by one indicator upon another indirectly-linked indicator. Links have been made based on the coverage of the indicator inferred by the indicator name. For example, D7 will eventually cover species supporting various ecosystem functions but for the immediate future it will focus on pollinators, so links were made on this basis.\n\nImportant considerations for interpretation of results\n\nThere are necessary time lags between data collection and presentation of results in the Outcome Indicator Framework. It is also not always possible to collect annual data for every indicator component. This means that the latest data point is not necessarily for the current calendar year and will differ across indicators depending on reporting frequency and time needed for data processing and analysis. Therefore, it is important to note the specific date range of the time period for each assessment result. This is provided in all the tables of assessment results in the individual indicator pages of this dashboard.\n\nAs outlined further in the method section, assessment categories are often assigned based on smoothed data. The percent change values presented next to assessment of change categories in tables of results will often be based on smoothed data. This means they may differ from values quoted elsewhere which are based on the raw, unsmoothed data, such as the trend description sections for individual indicators in this report. Tables of assessment results in the individual indicator pages of this dashboard always note whether percent change values are based on smoothed or unsmoothed data.\n\nAdditional policy context is required to judge whether an assessment category is telling a positive story. A category of ‘improvement’ is clearly better than ‘deterioration’ but may not be positive if it is only a very small improvement for an indicator where are large amount of change is needed to meet an associated policy aspiration. Conversely, a category of ‘little or no change’ may not be a serious concern if any policy goals have already been achieved and current environmental status just needs to be maintained. A small number of indicators are slow moving, and change may not be expected to be observed in the short term. The narrative provided with indicator specific assessment results in Section B highlights any important caveats such as these.\n\nSummary of results\n","id":""},"/assessment/results/air/index.html":{"type":"general.assessment","url":"/assessment/results/air/index.html","title":"Clean air\n","content":"\n    Figure 2 shows the proportion of indicators for which ‘Clean air’ is the primary goal that have been assigned to each\n        assessment category, with the exact number of indicator components shown as a label on the bars.\n    Of 10 indicator components, 6 showed an improvement over the short term.
