It sets out 10 goals for improving the environment in England. A commitment was also made to develop a comprehensive set of indicators to measure environmental change.\n\nWhat is the Outcome Indicator Framework?\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework report: Measuring environmental change: Outcome Indicator Framework for the 25 Year Environment Plan, was published in May 2019. Drawing on advice from a wide range of experts and stakeholders, it presented 66 indicators to give a comprehensive view of the environment and how it is changing. The 2019 report set out in detail the purpose of the Outcome Indicator Framework and examples of how the indicators can be used.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework has an important role in our longer-term understanding of the effectiveness of policies and interventions. The indicators are a systematic means of monitoring environmental change, recognising that complex natural and social systems will respond to change on a range of timescales.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework will:\n\n\n  enable clear communication of important environmental trends in England;\n  provide a set of indicators which relate to all aspects of the environment and all goals within the 25 Year Environment Plan;\n  communicate data which gives a high-level picture of the environment and how it is changing – more extensive data and indicators may additionally be available from other sources;\n  be used for assessment of changes in the natural environment, for example against the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan, or in applying a natural capital approach.\n\n\nWhat is a natural capital approach?\n\nNatural capital is defined as the ‘elements of the environment which provide valuable goods and services to people such as clean air, clean water, food and recreation’. A natural capital approach is advocated by the 25 Year Environment Plan as it accounts for all the different ways the environment benefits society and so can inform better decision making and the concept of natural capital was used to develop the Outcome Indicator Framework. A natural capital approach sets out the need to:\n\n\n  reduce pressures on natural capital (for example, pollution or plant disease);\n  improve the state of natural assets (including air, water, land and seas);\n  increase the benefits that we get from those assets.\n\n\nThe 66 outcome indicators can be considered as either a measure of (a) the pressure on natural capital assets, (b) the extent/condition of natural capital assets or (c) the service or benefit associated with natural capital assets. This classification is not always straightforward since the condition of one natural capital asset (for example, air quality) may place a pressure on another (for example, wildlife habitat). It is important to recognise that multiple interactions occur across the indicators and categories. By classifying these indicators in this way, we can also show which direction of change in the indicator reflects an improvement to environment (i.e. a downward trend for pressures and an upward trend for the condition of an asset or the provision of a benefit).\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\n\nWe have used 3 categories of reporting status for the indicators:\n\n\n  Final – no further significant development of the indicator is immediately expected, notwithstanding the future development of the framework as a whole.\n  Interim – further development is necessary for the indicator to be complete; for example, England-level data may need to be extracted from a UK wide dataset, additional data may need to be added to the indicator, or the methods used for deriving an indicator are expected to be further developed.\n  In development – the indicator is not currently available to report; further research is required and/or ongoing to determine the most suitable data and methods for analysis.\n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nIs the Outcome Indicator Framework an official or National Statistics publication?\n\nAlthough the report and this dashboard are not classified as official statistics or a National Statistic compendium publication, where possible we follow the UK’s Code of Practice for Statistics in its production and in the compilation of the indicator framework within it. The Official statistics section of this website explains how we have demonstrated voluntary compliance with many parts of the Code, in line with the Guide for Voluntary Application of the Code.\n\nWhat are Experimental Statistics?\n\nExperimental statistics are newly developed or innovative statistics published so that users and stakeholders can be involved in the assessment of their suitability and quality at an early stage. If you have feedback on any of our Experimental statistics in the Outcome Indicator Framework, please email us at &lt;{{ site.email_contact }}&gt;.\n\nHow often will new data be added to this site?\n\nWhere possible, we will provide annual updates to the Outcome Indicator Framework; these will include the introduction of new indicators together with updates to existing indicators we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible, in cooperation with topic experts.\n\nHow do I suggest new or different data sources?\n\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please email us at &lt;{{ site.email_contact }}&gt;.\n\nWhat are you doing to fill data gaps?\n\nThe technologies for monitoring and assessing change in the environment are advancing rapidly and offer new cost-effective methods (for example, Earth Observations, DNA methods, citizen science/mobile apps and new sensor technologies).

A commitment was made to develop a comprehensive set of indicators to measure environmental change. These indicators help us to show how the environment is changing over time. This will support the assessment of policies and other interventions, including how we are delivering on international and domestic commitments. In particular, the Outcome Indicator Framework can support the statutory cycle of monitoring, planning and reporting on progress in improving the environment which will be introduced through the Environment Bill.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework report: Measuring environmental change: Outcome Indicator Framework for the 25 Year Environment Plan, was published in May 2019. Drawing on advice from a wide range of experts and stakeholders, it presented 66 indicators to give a comprehensive view of the environment and how it is changing. The 2019 report set out in detail the purpose of the Outcome Indicator Framework and examples of how the indicators can be used.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework has an important role in our longer-term understanding of the effectiveness of policies and interventions. The indicators are a systematic means of monitoring environmental change, recognising that complex natural and social systems will respond to change on a range of timescales.\n\nThe Outcome Indicator Framework will:\n\n\n  \n    enable clear communication of important environmental trends in England;\n  \n  \n    provide a set of indicators which relate to all aspects of the environment and all goals within the 25 Year Environment Plan;\n  \n  \n    communicate data which gives a high-level picture of the environment and how it is changing – more extensive data and indicators may additionally be available from other sources;\n  \n  \n    be used for assessment of changes in the natural environment, for example against the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan, or in applying a natural capital approach.\n  \n\n","id":""},"/latest-update/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/latest-update/","title":"Latest annual update\n","content":"The 2021 report includes data on environmental trends for 45 of the 66 outcome indicators spanning across 9 of the 10 themes in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\nThree of the indicators presented in the 2021 report are classified as ‘Experimental Statistics’:\n\n\n  \n    B3 State of the water environment;\n  \n  \n    H4 Exposure and adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife in the environment;\n  \n  \n    K4 Extent and condition of terrestrial and marine protected areas in the UK Overseas Territories.\n  \n\n\nThese indicators are being published as Experimental Statistics in order to facilitate user involvement in their development – information on how the data have been obtained and how the indicators have been prepared is available via the links in the individual indicator pages.

Interim indicators are those where further development is expected to extend or improve the reporting against the indicator. Reporting interim indicators means that we can communicate data where they are available, whilst recognising that further development is necessary for the indicator to be complete. Examples of circumstances under which an indicator is considered to be interim include: data need to be extracted for England from a UK wide dataset, additional data need to be added to the indicator, or the methods used for deriving an indicator are expected to be further developed. The specific reason why an indicator is currently presented as interim is described in the individual indicator pages. Indicators are described as ‘final’ indicators where no further significant development is immediately expected, notwithstanding the future development of the framework as a whole.\n\nDue to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic indicator B4 Condition of bathing waters has not been updated due to disruption with data collection and analysis being delayed or suspended. A statement is included within the indicator’s readiness and links to data section noting how it may have implications for future updates.\n\nA limited number of changes have been made to the indicator descriptions over the last year. These reflect feedback and further consideration and development of the indicators to ensure the most appropriate data are presented.\n\nThere have been some specific changes to individual indicators after further consideration of their intended purpose, in order to better reflect alignment with 25 Year Environment Plan commitments and to deliver the insights required to support associated policy needs:\nModification of title for A7 from ‘Area of sensitive habitats exposed to damaging levels of ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere’ to ‘Area of land exposed to damaging levels of ammonia (NH3) in the atmosphere’. This modification is to better reflect the content as a description of ammonia exposure on all ecosystems, and not exclusively sensitive habitats. The actual data reported remain directly comparable to previous years.\n\nInclusion of additional metrics for B3 ‘State of the Water Environment’ to provide a more comprehensive insight on the condition of different water body types and on different elements, thus better fulfilling the indicator description.\n\nExtended reporting under B7 ‘Health of freshwaters assessed through fish populations’ to include fish classification data which reflect the status of fish species within rivers in England. This provides a more comprehensive insight as set out by the indicator description.\n\nModification of title for C3 from ‘Diverse seas: status of marine mammals, birds and fish’ to ‘Diverse seas: status of marine mammals and marine birds’. The removal of fish from this indicator is due to information on fish species population changes separately being reported in C7 ‘Healthy seas: fish and shellfish populations’.\n\nD6 ‘Abundance and distribution of priority species in England’ has been renamed ‘Relative abundance and distribution of priority species in England’ to clarify that it does not present population sizes in absolute terms; it instead presents an index to more simply describe large-scale changes across many species. This indicator additionally reports England-level data this year together with new information describing long and short-term insights.\n\nD7 ’Species supporting ecosystem functions’ additionally reports new information this year, describing long and short-term insights.\n\nA number of indicators remaining in development have recent progress described in their respective pages.\n","id":""},"/official-statistics/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/official-statistics/","title":"Official statistics\n","content":"The term official statistics comprises National Statistics, official statistics and Experimental Statistics.\n\nAll official statistics are produced by crown bodies, those acting on behalf of crown bodies, or those specified in statutory orders, as defined in the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007.\n\nNational Statistics have been assessed by the Office for Statistics Regulation, the regulatory arm of the UK Statistics Authority, as fully compliant with the Code of Practice for Statistics.

These are topics that people will generally recognise as relating to different aspects of the environment (for example, air, water, seas and estuaries, and wildlife). Some indicators may be applicable to one or more themes but have been allocated to just one of them. Detailed descriptions of each of the indicators are presented in this dashboard. The 25 Year Environment Plan goals and targets relevant to each indicator, the natural capital assets to which each indicator relates, and other relevant international reporting commitments are also detailed within these descriptions.\n\nThe readiness of each indicator is assessed in terms of whether it is already published or whether further development is required. Links are also provided to relevant data sources and data trends are presented where data are available in appropriate formats. In some instances, interim indicators are presented pending further development of the indicator; this is clearly identified where relevant. The geographic scope refers to intended coverage, any interim deviation from this is specified within individual indicator fiches.\n\nThe inclusion of 66 indicators in the framework provides a comprehensive and systematic means to observe and convey environmental change. However, for some purposes it may not be necessary to examine this large number of indicators. Therefore, in the framework we identify a sub-set of the indicators under 16 headlines; these are highlighted in the individual indicator pages. The headline indicators relate to key aspects of the environment which are a focus of policy intervention and should make intuitive sense to a wide range of readers. When complete, the framework will present a large amount of information and so we will highlight key indicators under headlines to provide a way to simplify this information and provide clear communication. Further examples on how the headlines and indicators may be used are given in Section B of the 2019 report.\n","id":""},"/using-the-framework/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/using-the-framework/","title":"Using the framework\n","content":"The Outcome Indicator Framework is designed to be adaptable for multiple uses. For example, to communicate environmental change or to support management of natural capital. By presenting a wide variety of data in a single location, the framework enables a holistic approach to analysis of environmental issues and decision making.\n\nThe concept of natural capital was used to develop the framework. Natural capital is defined as the ‘elements of the environment which provide valuable goods and services to people such as clean air, clean water, food and recreation’. A natural capital approach is advocated by the 25 Year Environment Plan as it accounts for all the different ways the environment benefits society and so can inform better decision making. A natural capital framework sets out the need to:\n\n\n  \n    reduce pressures on natural capital (for example, pollution or plant disease);\n  \n  \n    improve the state of natural assets (including air, water, land and seas);\n  \n  \n    increase the benefits that we get from those assets.\n  \n\n\nThe 66 outcome indicators can be considered as either a measure of (a) the pressure on natural capital assets, (b) the extent/condition of natural capital assets or (c) the service or benefit associated with natural capital assets. This classification is not always straightforward since the condition of one natural capital asset (for example, air quality) may place a pressure on another (for example, wildlife habitat). It is important to recognise that multiple interactions occur across the indicators and categories. By classifying these indicators in this way, we can also show which direction of change in the indicator reflects an improvement to the environment (that is a downward trend for pressures and an upward trend for the condition of an asset or the provision of a benefit). This structure is flexible, and indicators can be selected as appropriate to the needs of a particular analysis. Several examples of how the indicators may be used to examine specific questions are provided in our 2019 report. Monitoring and evaluation of these indicators can inform appropriate actions with an ultimate goal of maximising a healthy environment, economy and society.\n","id":""},"/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/goals/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/goals/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/reporting-status/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/reporting-status/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/indicators.json":{"type":"Pages","url":"/indicators.json","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/search/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/search/","title":"\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/8-1-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/8-1-1","title":"Indicator 8.1.1 - Abatement of the number of invasive non-native species entering and establishing against a baseline","content":"Short description\n\nBiosecurity measures to prevent the establishment of invasive non-native species are a key element of protecting against their significant economic, environmental and social impacts. This indicator will show how the number of invasive non-native species entering Great Britain has been abated (i.e. reduced) by comparing a predicted trend for establishment of invasive non-native species against actual establishment. Establishment of invasive species depends on factors such as trade and climate change. The difference to the trend in actual establishment then provides a measure of the success of biosecurity measures.\n\nThe indicator will draw on data from the Non-Native Species Information Portal, overseen by the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat, which maintains an early detection, surveillance and monitoring mechanism that facilitates management, including rapid response.

Volume of inputs may therefore be considered an indirect measure of pressure on a range of natural capital assets. This indicator should be viewed alongside the indicator E2 Volume of agricultural production and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets. The index of the volume of inputs is an overall measure of the total inputs used with price effects removed. This includes all inputs including intermediate consumption, land, labour and depreciation of capital.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK. Indicators and data on total factor productivity for England by farm typeare published as Experimental Statistics, but the National Statistics publication on total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\nTrend description\n\nThe index of volume of inputs has shown an overall decline since 1973. Most of this decline took place between the late 1990s and 2006 and since then there has been a slight increase in the volume of inputs used in agricultural production. The volume remains below historical levels.\n","id":"5.3.1"},"/4-3-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/4-3-1","title":"Indicator 4.3.1 - Area of woodland in England","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator shows change in the area of broadleaved and conifer woodland in England.

Such lists are published by the Secretary of State under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. There are over 940 priority species recognised in England.\n\nThis indicator has 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those priority species for which suitable abundance data are available; and, (b) changes in distribution (the number of 1 km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of those priority species for which distribution data are available.\n\nThe taxonomic coverage of this indicator is limited at present. The relative abundance measure includes priority birds, butterflies, some mammals (one hare and 5 bats) and moths but does not currently include plants, fungi, amphibians, reptiles, fish or invertebrates other than butterflies and moths; the distribution measure includes priority species of bryophytes, lichens, insects and other invertebrates but does not currently include amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish or mammals.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. Trends for the relative abundance and distribution of priority species at a UK-level are already presented annually in the UK Biodiversity Indicators; however, further work has been undertaken to develop equivalent measures at an England-only level. The results of this work are presented here for the first time in 2021 as a revised interim indicator. Information on how these data have been obtained and how the statistics have been calculated is available on the Defra science portal. The report includes a technical background document that describes the data sources and methods in detail, and spreadsheets that contain a list of species within each index together with the data behind the indices. Methods are being developed to refine the future reporting of this indicator and to expand the taxonomic coverage. These methods are still undergoing peer review and user feedback is invited via 25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk.\n\nNote\n\nOf the more than 940 species in the priority species list for England, 149 have robust quantitative time-series data on relative abundance and 181 have suitable distribution data. The relative abundance measure comprises Birds (44), Butterflies (21), Mammals (6) and Moths (78); the distribution measure includes Bees (13), Bryophytes (9), Lichens (16), Moths (93), Spiders, (9) and Wasps (7). Approximately 60 species of moths appear in both the relative abundance and distribution measures; the remaining species within this indicator are unique to one or other of the measures because they are drawn from different data sources. The abundance datasets are generated largely from data collected by national monitoring schemes, whereas the distribution data are collated through the Biological Records Centre and include contributions from a wide range of national recording schemes (see the technical background document referenced in the ‘Readiness and links to data’ section for further detail).\n\nTrend description\n\na) Changes in abundance of priority species\n\nBy 2018, the index of relative abundance of priority species in England had declined to 17.7% of its base-line value in 1970, a statistically significant decrease. Over this long-term period, 7% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 83% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2013 and 2018, the relative abundance index\ndeclined from 21.3 to 17.7 (17% of the 2013 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 20% of species showed a strong or weak increase\nand 56% showed a strong or weak decline.\n\nb) Changes in distribution of priority species\n\nBy 2016, the index of distribution of priority species in England decreased to 84, a statistically significant decrease of 16% of the 1970 value. Over this long-term period, 24%\nof species showed a strong or weak increase and 38% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2011 and 2016, the distribution index declined from 92.3 to 83.7 (9% of the 2011 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 13% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 59% showed a strong or weak decline.\n","id":"4.6.1"},"/4-7-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/4-7-1","title":"Indicator 4.7.1 - Species supporting ecosystem functions","content":"Short description\n\nAll species have a functional role within ecosystems such as photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, nutrient cycling, predator-prey and symbiotic relationships such as pollination.

The assessments of marine mammals will be based on trends in the abundance of harbour seals; Atlantic grey seal pup production; and the abundance of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). The assessments of marine birds will be based on the proportion of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds that have met abundance targets, which were set to inform progress towards Good Environmental Status (GES). The GES assessments of marine mammals and birds were used in the updated UK Marine Strategy (UKMS) Part One (2019) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form as some further development is being undertaken. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (a) changes in the abundance of harbour seals and the production of Atlantic grey seal pups in the north-east and south-east of England, and (b) changes in the abundance of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas (OSPAR marine regions including data from neighbouring countries). The assessments of seals and marine birds used for this interim indicator have been reported at a UK scale under the updated UKMS Part One (2019). The assessment for seals used data from 1994 to 2014, the most recent data on seals presented in the charts below are published by the Special Committee on Seals (SCOS). The indicator will be kept under review during the development of ‘D5 Conservation status of our native species’ as some elements of this indicator may ultimately be included in D5 instead. Cetaceans are not yet included in this indicator, but they will be once more definitive assessments can be made. Whale and dolphin species were assessed in the UKMS Part One (2019) using data on abundance. However, for most species, trends in abundance could not be determined because there were an insufficient number of population estimates.\n\nNote\n\nWhile the data currently available for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in this interim indicator predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of changes in GES of seals and marine birds. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTrends in harbour seal abundance are derived from counts of seals on land in August of each year when they are moulting; Atlantic grey seal status is assessed using counts of pups that estimate pup production at major breading sites. Targets for GES were met if harbour seal abundance and Atlantic grey seal pup production: a) declined by less than an average of 1% per year during 2009 to 2014, or b) decreased by less than 25% since the baseline year (1992 or start of time series, if later). The UKMS Part One (2019) GES assessment for seals covered the Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea.\n\nGES is achieved for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds if 75% or more species meet or exceed their thresholds for relative abundance (the dashed horizontal line on Figure C3b). The relative abundance of a species is the annual abundance expressed as a proportion of the baseline, which was taken as the abundance at the start of the timeseries in 1992. Thresholds for relative abundance were set to define GES: greater than 80% of the baseline for species that lay one egg and greater than 70% of the baseline for species that lay more than one egg.\n\nTrend description\n\na)\tSeals\n\nTrends in harbour seal numbers in eastern England have been largely positive since the mid-1990s, although they appear to have levelled off and then fallen between 2015 and 2019. In the south-east, where the majority of the England population are found, numbers have fluctuated showing an increase from 2,793 in 1995 to 4,944 in 2018 followed by a sharp decline to 3,752 in 2019. Numbers are much lower in north-east England; they have shown a steady increase from 45 animals in 1994 to 91 in 2015 before declining to 79 in 2019. The UKMS Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1994 to 2014 concluded that because of declines in Scotland, GES had not been achieved for harbour seal abundance in the UK Greater North Sea sub-region (which includes seal populations in the north-east and south-east England). \nIn south-east England annual Atlantic grey seal pup production has risen exponentially from just 200 pups in 1992 to 7,902 pups in 2019. In north-east England the rise in pup production has been steadier, from 985 pups in 1992 to 2,823 in 2019. The UKMS Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1992 to 2014 concluded that GES for Atlantic grey seals has been achieved in the Greater North Sea.\n\nb)\tMarine birds\n\nThe proportion of seabird species meeting thresholds for breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas has remained stable since 2012 but remains below the 75% target (59% in the Greater North Sea in 2014 and 63% in the Celtic Seas in 2015). The UKMS (2019) assessment concluded GES for breeding seabirds has not been achieved in the Greater North Sea or Celtic Seas.\nThe proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds for non-breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea has declined sharply, but is still on target (78% in 2013/14); the proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds in the Celtic Seas has also declined sharply (53% in 2014/15) and has remained below target since 2006.

The indicator combines data on the intensity and distribution of pressures from human activities with data on the distribution and sensitivity of seabed habitats. Data from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) showing fishing activity are linked to vessel logbook information and processed to create a layer showing abrasion pressure on the seabed. A second layer is produced by combining data on distribution of seabed habitats with information on resilience and resistance to evaluate their sensitivity to the pressure. The pressure and sensitivity layers are combined using a spatial method to create a single data layer showing the area of seabed subject to high disturbance from human activity. This indicator is linked to the “Extent of Physical Damage to Predominant and Special Habitats” indicator, developed for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and used for the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES).\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form as some changes to the method are needed to include additional activities and improve habitat sensitivity assessment. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the predicted area of seabed in the UK Continental Shelf exposed to disturbance from bottom contact fishing by vessels over 12 m long. The assessments used for this interim indicator, including data and analytical methods, have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019). Inclusion of other human activities, including small fishing vessels without VMS, and improved sensitivity information are in development and will be available as part of the OSPAR Quality Status Report in 2023.\n\nNote\n\nThe degree of disturbance of a habitat is an index based on the predicted spatial and temporal overlap of its sensitivity and exposure to a specific pressure. Sensitivity is assessed using the distribution of habitats and information on species presence collected across the reporting cycle (2010 to 2015). The annual values of the distribution and intensity of pressure are aggregated to give an average pressure intensity for reporting cycle. If the pressure intensity is highly variable across the 6-year period in an area the highest value is taken. Sensitivity and pressure are combined via a matrix, producing 10 categories of disturbance ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 9 (greatest disturbance possible).\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the physical damage to benthic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nA lack of data relating to the activities of smaller fishing vessels (less than 12 m) exists as they are not equipped with a VMS recorder. Consequently, there is an underestimate of disturbance in inshore waters. Due to the analytical methods used there is a potential overestimate of disturbance as a consequence of assuming an even distribution of fishing pressures.\n\nTrend description\n\nThere is currently no trend assessment due to the indicator not being considered previously. Changes over time might be identified by comparing results from multiple reporting cycle assessments such those produced by the UK Marine Strategy every 6 years. Future assessments will enable any trends to be identified, for example the number of regions achieving GES.\n\nThe results from 2010 to 2015 show pressure and disturbance caused by fishing activities to be widespread, occurring to some degree in 57% of the cells within UK waters. The charts show the aggregated values for seafloor disturbance from bottom fishing for the period 2010 to 2015. The highest level of disturbance is found in the English Channel and Southern Celtic Seas with 75% of both these areas being subject to high disturbance (categories 5 to 9). The extent of disturbance in the Northern North Sea and Southern North Sea is lower, 50% and 48% respectively, but still considerably above the target figure for GES. Within each assessment area there are grid cells showing no disturbance or low disturbance (categories 0 to 4), such as some central areas of the Northern North Sea. The Wider Atlantic (OSPAR Region V) was the only region to achieve GES over the assessment period 2010 to 2015 with 12% of its area subjected to high disturbance from bottom contact fishing.\n","id":"3.2.1"},"/9-1-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/9-1-1","title":"Indicator 9.1.1 - Carbon footprint and consumer buying choices","content":"Short description\n\nThis indicator tracks the carbon footprint of England’s residents, by showing changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with final demand for goods and services in England, wherever the emissions arise across the globe.

They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTrend description\n\na)\tChanges in plankton communities, 2004-2008 to 2009-2014\n\nThe lifeforms (functional groups of species) that make up the plankton communities in the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea changed between the starting conditions period (2004 to 2008) and the current assessment period (2009 to 2014). Prevailing environmental conditions, in particular, climate change, are likely to be driving these observed changes, but the potential role of direct human activities such as fishing and nutrient inputs contributing to these changes cannot be ruled out. It is currently uncertain whether GES has been achieved.\n\nb)\tChanges in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance, 2004-2008 to 2009-2014\n\nIn most areas of the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea, phytoplankton biomass has increased between the starting conditions period (2004 to 2008) and the current assessment period (2009 to 2014). Changes in zooplankton abundance varied across the 2 sub-regions assessed, with increases in some areas, decreases in others, and no change in some. This assessment identified, with a medium to high level of confidence, changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance which may have consequences on the functioning, dynamics and structure of the whole marine ecosystem. It is not yet possible to say if GES has been achieved.\n","id":"3.5.1"},"/10-3-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/10-3-1","title":"Indicator 10.3.1 - Status of endemic and globally threatened species in the UK Overseas Territories","content":"Short description\n\nUK Overseas Territories are home to rich, globally important biodiversity, with many species found nowhere else in the world.

Green and blue spaces and features in and around our built environment, including within Green Belts, are essential to health and well-being. This indicator will be developed from work led by Natural England, with Defra and an advisory group, on a new national framework of standards for green and blue infrastructure. These standards aim to green our towns and cities, by improving existing green infrastructure provision and encouraging more investment. The Standards will guide stakeholders to focus on areas where we know that there is not enough accessible green infrastructure, or that what is there is of poor quality. The Standards will also guide the inclusion of accessible green space in new developments and advise the improvement of any area with little or no green space for the benefit of the community. Green and blue infrastructure can also make an important contribution towards adaptation to climate change.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021.

Data are currently available for specific chemicals in birds of prey, water, fish, mammals, and shellfish. Other exposure data for chemicals will be incorporated should they become available in the future. The indicator will also be developed to consider the adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife populations and individuals.\n\nThis indicator is complementary to other indicators within the framework that give data on environmental pressures from chemicals, for example ‘B1 Pollution loads entering waters’ and ‘H3 Emissions of mercury and persistent organic pollutants to the environment’.\n\nReadiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here as an Experimental Statistic that covers the exposure of wildlife to chemicals in the environment and, where feasible, the risk from different types of chemicals to wildlife on land and in water. The indicator is based on chemical \nconcentrations found in water and in different organisms – sparrowhawk/red kite, red fox (data extraction under development), freshwater fish, otter, blue mussel, dab, and harbour porpoise. It covers 3 environmental compartments: terrestrial, freshwater and marine (estuarine, coastal and offshore) The chemicals are representative of 3 groups highlighted for attention under the 25 Year Environment Plan: persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances, heavy metals, and pesticides and biocides.\n\nThese data are being published as an Experimental Statistic in order to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator. We would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via 25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk. Further details on the indicator development and data analysis used are given in the supporting H4 indicator report. Some data relevant to this indicator are published: Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme – contaminant exposure, Water Quality Data Archive, British Oceanographic Data Centre – Monitoring and Assessment National database (MERMAN).\n\nA trial of this interim indicator was independently reviewed in 2020. We will continue to work with partners through 2021 to improve our reporting based on recommendations and our findings. We will seek to address data gaps for all substances to get a fuller picture across compartments and improve our ability to report exposure trends. Future work will also consider methods for reporting the effects on wildlife of chemicals in the environment.\n\nNote\n\nAvailable thresholds for wildlife have been used to provide context to the most-recent national concentrations; their use to indicate risk does not represent a compliance assessment and should not be compared with other regulatory reporting regimes which may use values with different protection goals. The approach for deriving thresholds is specific to the wildlife or environmental medium being considered because of the data available and the purpose for which it was gathered. Monitoring networks and thresholds can change over time.\n\nThe freshwater risk assessment for pesticides is currently based on a threshold for short-term toxic effects. In the future, a long-term threshold will be used to reflect risks from chronic exposure.\n\nAdditional data are available for otter, freshwater fish and red fox which cannot be incorporated into the dashboard at present, but are provided in the supporting report to this indicator. The report also contains information on spatial variation in results for freshwater metals sites and for marine fish.\n\nTrend description\n\nPBT substances\n\nDownward trends are observed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in marine fish (dab) and for PBDEs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in harbour porpoise. These trends are particularly evident for PBDEs.\n\nExceedance of thresholds is most significant for mercury in the freshwater and marine environments, followed by PCBs in the marine environment. The result for mercury in dab may be over-precautionary for reasons given in the supporting report.\n\nHeavy metals\n\nFor heavy metals, downward trends are observed for nickel and zinc in sparrowhawks, although the data are only available up to 2014. There is an upward trend for nickel in dab, \nwhich is driven by eastern and southern coastal marine sites.\n\nThe exceedance of the nickel threshold in estuarine and coastal waters is only driven by one site. Zinc shows the highest rate of threshold exceedance of the metals in both freshwater and estuarine and coastal waters.\n\nWhile the freshwater data for heavy metals show no change in concentrations from 2014 to 2019, these results can be split into 2 types: those for sites where the waters are affected by abandoned metal mines and those for sites in other locations. Cadmium and copper exhibit downward trends for the ‘other’ sites over the assessed time period. For waters affected by abandoned metal mines, their elevated levels of metals mean that they comprise a high proportion of those sites above available thresholds, except for nickel \nwhere sites in other locations comprise the majority of those at risk.\n\nPesticides and biocides\n\nIt is not possible to assess trends currently for pesticides and second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs). Risk is indicated for less than a quarter of sites or \nindividuals considered for pesticides in water and SGARs in red kite.\n","id":"8.4.1"},"/3-11-1":{"type":"Indicators","url":"/3-11-1","title":"Indicator 3.11.1 - Productive seas: status of sensitive fish and shellfish stocks","content":"Short Description\n\nThis indicator will track changes in the abundance, distribution and condition of fish and shellfish species at risk of depletion.

It consists of 2 metrics. The first metric looks at the size of the fish in a community (Typical Length) and the second looks at the composition of fish communities (Mean Maximum Length). Together these metrics tell us about the health and status of fish communities. A healthy fish community will be made up of species in the expected ratio of numbers of individuals, and with individual species showing the age classes and sizes consistent with a healthy population. Typical Length: a reduction in the proportion of larger, older, fish (as measured by Typical Length) of several species, suggests the top (predator) level of the food web is in poor condition. Mean Maximum Length: if the species that tend towards larger individuals are depleted and smaller-bodied species become more abundant (shown by a reduction in Mean Maximum Length), the species composition of the community can change, suggesting prolonged periods of pressure.

In the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the balance of species within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller bodied fish (low Typical Length) indicating this community is in poorer health.
