This indicator will therefore aim to show the benefits to human health and well-being that can be gained through England\u2019s natural environments. This includes benefits gained from more people engaging with nature, but also more passive benefits through improvements in natural environments that may impact on human health and well-being (for example, improvements in air quality, climate regulation, and noise mitigation). The indicator will aim to track changes for people in disadvantaged groups and others who may benefit the most.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that presents baseline data on self-reported mental and physical health benefits of nature from Natural England\u2019s nationally representative [People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england) (PANS) for adults. PANS began collecting data on an on-going basis from 2 April 2020 and can now report on this interim indicator after one year of data collection (up to 31 March 2021). Further information on PANS survey methods, outputs and the full questionnaires, are available on the [PANS homepage](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england#monthly-interim-indicators). The PANS team welcome collaboration and feedback via the [PANS user hub](https://people-and-nature-survey-defra.hub.arcgis.com/).\n\nSimilar data for children from the [Children\u2019s People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics) (C-PANS) will be included in the 2023 Outcome Indicator Framework report.\n\nThis interim indicator may be superseded following an assessment of more appropriate national data to evidence the health and well-being implications of improvements in quality, access to and engagement with England\u2019s natural environments.\n\n## Trend description for Figure G7\n\nThe PANS survey cannot yet show yearly trends. However, data from 2020/2021 show that, the majority (94%) of adults who had visited green and natural spaces in the last 14 days felt that spending time outdoors was good for their physical health, and 92% thought it was good for their mental health.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-10","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-08-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/7ba21291aafda3353dd8a65d3190d312fbf177bd","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-08-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/7ba21291aafda3353dd8a65d3190d312fbf177bd","indicator":"7.7.1","target_id":"7.7","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-07-01"}
