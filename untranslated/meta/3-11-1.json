The indicator will be derived from individual species assessments; note that some species may also be included in C6 Diverse seas: status of threatened and declining features. The indicator will be assessed to account for the expected status in line with prevailing environmental conditions and not adversely impacted by human activity. The indicator is linked to the UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 1 biodiversity and Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 as further development is required. Analytical methods and some data on [sensitive fish species](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/biodiversity-status/fish-and-food-webs/recovery-sensitive-fish/) are available.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"3.11.1","target_id":"3.11","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-11-01","graph_title":"Productive seas: status of sensitive fish and shellfish stocks"}
