Woodland as defined for the National Forest Inventory is land under stands of trees with a minimum area of 0.5 hectares, a width of at least 20 metres, and a canopy cover of at least 20% or having the potential to achieve this. The definition relates to land use, rather than land cover, so integral open space and areas of felled trees that are awaiting restocking (replanting) are included as woodland. Woodland is a key natural capital asset that provides many natural capital benefits, such as the provision of timber and other wood products, carbon storage, habitats for wildlife, and opportunities for exercise and recreation.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on the area of woodland are published annually in Forest Research\u2019s [Forestry Statistics](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/forestry-statistics/) along with information on the data sources and methodology. Additional commentary on recent trends and new planting of woodland and trees in England is provided in the Forestry Commission\u2019s quarterly [Key Performance Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators).\n\n## Trend description for Figure D3\n\nThe total area of woodland in England has increased from 1.19 million hectares in 1980 to 1.32 million hectares in 2021, equating to an increase from 9.1% to 10.1% of the land area of England. This growth has been driven by an increase in broadleaf woodland. The area of conifer woodland in England has remained relatively static over the last 40 years.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nOver the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2016 to 2021) and in the medium term (2011 to 2021), the observed increases in the area of woodland in England count as \u2018little or no change\u2019. This is because it would take a large area of additional woodland cover to reach the +3% change needed to for the \u2018improvement\u2019 category to be assigned. There has been an increase (improvement) over the long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. Change since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been \u2018little or no change\u2019 in woodland cover since 2018.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

NO2 arises predominantly from combustion sources such as traditionally fuelled vehicles and therefore the highest concentrations are often found at roadside locations.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as a pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the average value of the annual mean concentrations measured across Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) at all roadside locations (with greater than 75% data capture in any one year).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on concentrations of NO2 are published annually as [National Statistics; Air Quality Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/air-quality-statistics).\n\n## Trend description for Figure A5\n\nConcentrations of roadside NO2 in England have fallen from 59.7\u03bcg per m3 in 1997 to 23.0\u03bcg per m3 in 2020, a drop of 49% over the latest 23 years for which data are available. Although the general trend in measured NO2 concentrations is decreasing and falls below the NO2 limit value of 40\u03bcg per m3 in recent years, there are hotspots of NO2 exceedances which are being addressed through the NO2 plans.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nRoadside NO2 concentrations decreased (an improvement) over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and over the medium and long-term time periods. Targets for NO2 are set at a regional scale rather than for the England average recorded by this indicator, so it would not be appropriate to use results to establish whether targets have been met.\n\n You can find more information on trends and monitoring at a regional level can be found in the [Air Pollution in the UK report](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/annualreport/index).\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. A decrease in roadside NO2 concentrations was also observed since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

For mercury, which is covered by the Minamata Convention, combustion sources are particularly significant, and information on emissions is provided annually by larger industrial sites. Other major sources of mercury to air will be gathered from different data sources.\n\nPOPs are chemicals that are extremely persistent in the environment, become widely distributed geographically, are able to accumulate in the tissues of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health and the environment. POPs within this indicator refers to pollutants listed under Annex C (unintentional produced) of the Stockholm Convention. The Convention covers a range of substances spanning industrial uses, pesticides, and unintentionally produced substances.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in a final format in 2022 as further development is required to bring data together from a number of different sources. A revised interim indicator is presented here that shows annual England-level emissions of (a) mercury from larger industrial sites and crematoria, and (b) 7 unintentionally produced POP substances (as listed in the Stockholm Convention Annex C): polychlorinated biphenyls; dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls; dioxins and furans; hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated naphthalenes; pentachlorophenol; and pentachlorobenzene from a wide range of sources to air, land, and water. These POPs data are a disaggregation of the annual UK-level data previously presented in this indicator.\n\nSome information is already published: [Pollution Inventory](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cfd94301-a2f2-48a2-9915-e477ca6d8b7e/pollution-inventory), [National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1030), [Persistent Organic Pollutants Multimedia Emissions Inventory](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=19672&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=persistent%20organic%20pollutants&GridPage=1&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10#Description), and [National Reports for the Stockholm Convention](http://www.pops.int/Countries/Reporting/NationalReports/tabid/3668/Default.aspx). [Population estimates](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates) used to apportion some UK emissions of POPs at an England level are also published annually.\n\nFor further information on the methodology used to produce this indicator email [chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk](mailto:chemicalrestrictions@environment-agency.gov.uk).\n\n## Trend description for Figures H3a and H3b\n\n### H3a) Emissions of mercury to air, land and water\n\nIn 2019, emissions of mercury from larger industrial sites and crematoria in England totalled 1,652 kg, with larger industrial sites accounting for 68% of this figure.\n\n### H3b) Emissions of persistent organic pollutants to air, land and water\n\nEmissions attributed to England for all 7 POPs included within this indicator have fallen between 2000 and 2019.\n\nDioxins and furans are a family of chemicals strongly associated with thermal processes linked to combustion (particularly of waste) and manufacture of metals. Their emissions were already reduced by over 60% between 1990 and 2000, with improvements in technology and tighter environmental regulations contributing to this fall. Between 2000 and 2010, emissions of dioxins and furans fell by a further 43% but have since levelled out, with emissions post-2010 largely linked to more diffuse sources such as domestic combustion of solid fossil fuels, accidental fire, and illegal burning of waste.\n\nBy 2013, emissions of hexachlorobenzene had fallen to 27% of their 2000 baseline figure but they have risen annually since then to reach 52% of emissions in 2000. This is linked to waste incineration and the increasing use of a specific pesticide (chlorothalonil) for which it is a by-product. Emissions of pentachlorophenol have fallen consistently since 2000 to reach 31% of their baseline figure in 2019. Emissions of the remaining 4 POPs have followed a very similar pattern to each other, falling sharply in the first 10 years and then levelling out to between 11% and 18% of their baseline figures in 2019. In particular for polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, this relates to remaining final in-use stocks of heat-transfer fluids in di-electric equipment in the energy transmission networks.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nA decrease (or improvement) was observed for all emissions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to air land and water covered by the interim H3 indicator, over the medium and long term. Most POPs also decrease over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018); however, little or no change was seen in emission of polychlorinated naphthalenes during this period, and there was an increase (deterioration) in hexachlorobenzene.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there has been a mixed picture with 3 POPs decreasing, 3 showing little or no change, and hexachlorobenzene increasing. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table H3bi: Assessment of change in the emissions of dioxins and furans to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -5 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -19.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -53.1 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table H3bii: Assessment of change in the emissions of hexachlorobenzene to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +57.2 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -27.9 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -46.4 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table H3biii: Assessment of change in the emissions of pentachlorophenol to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -28.6 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -47.1 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -66.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table H3biv: Assessment of change in the emissions of polychlorinated biphenyl to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -28.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -59.1 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -88.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table H3bv: Assessment of change in the emissions of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -40.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -61.4 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -88.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table H3bvi: Assessment of change in the emissions of polychlorinated naphthalenes to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +2.7 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -34.9 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -81.7 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table H3bvii: Assessment of change in the emissions of pentachlorobenzine to air, land and water, England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -15.5 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -34.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2000-2018 | -84.6 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\nNote that assessment categories for the short, medium and long term were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables H3bi to H3bvii may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

This indicator helps us to better understand the levels of, and trends in, the economic productive utilisation of English timber resources as a part of sustainable forest management policies and practices.\n\nThe underlying data sources are National Statistics from Forest Research on UK Wood Production and Trade and National Forest Inventory forecasts of increase (increment) in the volume of wood that grows in England.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on the percentage of the annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested are published in the [Forestry Commission\u2019s Key Performance Indicators Reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators).\n\n## Trend description for Figure E5\n\nThe percentage of softwood growth in England which is harvested has fluctuated between 67% and 92% over the 11 years for which these data are reported, reflecting sustained active management of softwood resources. The percentage of hardwood growth which is harvested has increased slightly, although it remains much lower (between 13% and 20% over the same 11-year period), reflecting a lower level of active management of broadleaved woodland for timber supplies.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the percentage of the total annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested (hardwood and softwood combined) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020). There has been an increase (or improvement) over the medium term (2010 to 2020). The time series is not yet sufficient to make an assessment for a long-term period.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been a decrease (or deterioration) in the percentage of annual growth harvested since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

They were identified to support UK conservation planning and are published and maintained by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Priority species are used as the reference source to produce statutory species lists of principal conservation importance. Such lists are published by the Secretary of State under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. There are over 940 priority species recognised in England.\n\nThis indicator has 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those priority species for which suitable abundance data are available; and (b) changes in distribution (the number of 1km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of those priority species for which distribution data are available. The relative abundance of a species will increase when the population of the species grows; it will decrease when the population of the species declines. The occupancy index will increase when a species becomes more widespread; it will decrease when a species becomes less widespread.\n\nThe taxonomic coverage of this indicator is limited at present. The relative abundance measure includes priority birds, butterflies, some mammals (one hare and 5 bats) and moths but does not currently include plants, fungi, amphibians, reptiles, fish or invertebrates other than butterflies and moths; the distribution measure includes priority species of bryophytes, lichens, insects and other invertebrates but does not currently include amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish or mammals.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. Trends for the relative abundance and distribution of priority species at an England-level were presented here for the first time in 2021 as a revised interim indicator, but there are no new data available to update this indicator in 2022. Further details about this indicator, including a technical background document that describes the data sources and methods in detail, and spreadsheets that contain a list of species within each index together with the data behind the indices are published annually as [England Biodiversity Indicators 4a and 4b \u2013 Status of priority species: relative abundance and distribution](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Methods are being developed to refine the future reporting of this indicator and to expand the taxonomic coverage.\n\nThese methods are still undergoing peer review and user feedback is invited via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk).\n\n## Note on Figures D6ai, D6aii, D6bi and D6bii\n\nOf the more than 940 species in the priority species list for England, 149 have robust quantitative time-series data on relative abundance and 181 have suitable distribution data. The relative abundance measure comprises Birds (44), Butterflies (21), Mammals (6) and Moths (78); the distribution measure comprises Bees (13), Bryophytes (9), Lichens (16), Moths (93), Spiders (9), Wasps (7), and 34 species representing other taxonomic groups. Approximately 60 species of moths appear in both the relative abundance and distribution measures; the remaining species within this indicator are unique to one or other of the measures because they are drawn from different data sources. The abundance datasets are generated largely from data collected by national monitoring schemes, whereas the distribution data are collated through the Biological Records Centre and include contributions from a wide range of national recording schemes (see the technical background document referenced in the \u2018Readiness and links to data\u2019 section for further detail).\n\n## Trend description for Figures D6ai, D6aii, D6bi and D6bii\n\n### D6a) Changes in abundance of priority species\n\nBy 2018, the index of relative abundance of priority species in England had declined to 17.7% of its base-line value in 1970, a statistically significant decrease. Over this long-term period, 7% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 83% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2013 and 2018, the relative abundance index declined from 21.3 to 17.7 (17% of the 2013 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 20% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 56% showed a strong or weak decline.\n\n### D6b) Changes in distribution of priority species\n\nBy 2016, the index of distribution of priority species in England decreased to 84, a statistically significant decrease of 16% of the 1970 value. Over this long-term period, 24% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 38% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2011 and 2016, the distribution index declined from 92.3 to 83.7 (9% of the 2011 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 13% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 59% showed a strong or weak decline.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nIndicators for relative abundance and distribution of priority species in England are also reported in the [England Biodiversity Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators), which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is more tailored to the specific dataset and factors-in information on confidence. No results were available for the medium-term period using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology, although this will be considered for the next publication. The assessment found a decrease (or deterioration) in both the relative abundance and distribution of priority species in England over the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There were also decreases recorded over the long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in sections 4a and b of the latest [England Biodiversity Indicators report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Further information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table D6a: Assessment of change in the relative abundance of priority species in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -17.2 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1970-2018 | -82.3 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table D6b: Assessment of change in the distribution of priority species in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2011-2016 | -9.3 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1970-2016 | -16.3 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n\nNote that smoothed data presented in the indicator charts were used for percent change calculations.

Green and blue spaces and other natural features in and around our built environment, including within Green Belts, are part of networks of multi-functional green infrastructure, which are capable of delivering a wide range of benefits that are essential to health and wellbeing, nature, climate, water and prosperity. Green and blue infrastructure includes land, freshwater and coastal spaces.\n\nThis indicator will be developed from work led by Natural England, with Defra and an advisory group, on a new [Green Infrastructure Framework \u2013 Principles and Standards for England](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/GreenInfrastructure/Home.aspx) which will cover both green and blue infrastructure. These standards aim to green our towns and cities, by improving existing green infrastructure provision and encouraging more investment. Green and blue infrastructure can also make an important contribution towards adaptation to climate change.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. However, an interim indicator is presented here, which is based on Natural England\u2019s updated [Accessible Natural Greenspace Standards](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/GreenInfrastructure/UserGuide/Section05.aspx#angst) (ANGSt). These standards will inform the development of indicators for accessible greenspace quantity and proximity, at different scales.\n\nNatural England and Defra have also developed initial [baseline maps of Green and Blue Infrastructure](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/GreenInfrastructure/Map.aspx) across England (version 1.1), for analysis using the updated ANGSt and other standards and indicators in development. The [England Green Infrastructure Mapping Database Report](http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4635531295326208) provides details of the Green Infrastructure Mapping datasets and analysis (and of the updated ANGSt). Initial findings are published on the [Green Infrastructure Mapping Database and Analyses](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/GreenInfrastructure/MappingAnalysis.aspx) webpage.\n\nThe ANGSt include a measure of hectares of Local Nature Reserve (LNR) per 1,000 population, and this analysis will be undertaken using data on LNRs held in [Designated Sites View](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/) to report in 2023.\n\nOutputs of further analysis of the Green Infrastructure Mapping will be considered for providing additional information in the final indicator, including more detailed statistical analysis of population shares within ANGSt buffers by index of deprivation, population density and green space per 1,000 population, and also access to waterside and linear access such as Public Rights of Way.\n\nInformation on changes in the public\u2019s perceptions of green and blue space quality and access to green and blue spaces is now gathered by Natural England using the [People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england) (PANS) for England. A new indicator, derived from the PANS results, is in development.\n\n## Note on Figure G3\n\nFigure G3 covers both urban and rural areas. Doorstep Greenspace is accessible greenspace of at least 0.5 hectares in size within a 200m straight-line distance from home; Local Greenspace is accessible natural greenspace of at least 2 hectares in size within a 300m straight-line distance from home; and Neighbourhood Greenspace is accessible natural greenspace of at least 10 hectares within a 1km straight-line distance from home. The combined greenspace category, while not a standard in itself, includes the percentage of the population with access to any one or more of the doorstep greenspace, and local and neighbourhood natural greenspace standards.\n\n## Trend description for Figure G3\n\nThis is the baseline year of data; we aim to build a time series that is updated at the frequency new mapping is undertaken. As of October 2021, the proportions of the total population in England living within ANGSt \u2018buffers\u2019 (straight line distances from the boundary of the greenspaces) are:\n\n* 1 in 3 people live within 200m of a doorstep greenspace of at least 0.5 hectares\n* 1 in 4 people live within 300m of a local natural greenspace of at least 2 hectares, and\n* 1 in 2 people live within 1km of a neighbourhood natural greenspace of at least 10 hectares\n\nWhen considered together, these 3 most local ANGSt buffers allow us to form a composite picture of accessible greenspace. Initial findings suggest that, as of October 2021, almost 2 in 3 people (62.2%) have access to greenspace as defined by one or more of the doorstep greenspace, local natural greenspace and neighbourhood natural greenspace standards included within this indicator, and hence within a maximum 1km radius of home.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"7.3.1","target_id":"7.3","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-03-01"},"3-1-1":{"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"C1a (interim)","units":"Items / 100m"},{"series":"C1b (interim)","units":"Percentage"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values_by_series":[{"field":"Area","series":"C1a (interim)","value":"Celtic Seas"},{"field":"Area","series":"C1a (interim)","value":"Greater North Sea"},{"field":"Area","series":"C1b (interim)","value":"Greater North Sea"}],"embedded_feature_footer":"components/embedded-features/C1c-footer.html","embedded_feature_html":"components/embedded-features/C1c.html","embedded_feature_layout":"single","embedded_feature_tab_title":"Map, C1c (interim)","embedded_feature_title":"C1c (interim): Smoothed median total of seafloor litter items per km<sup>2</sup>, UK, 2012 to 2015","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_category_color":{"C1a (interim)":{"Celtic Seas":"#F46A25","Greater North Sea":"#12436D"},"C1b (interim)":{"Greater North Sea":"#12436D"}},"graph_category_order":{"C1a (interim)":{"Celtic Seas":1,"Greater North Sea":0}},"graph_geographical_areas":[{"area":"UK (Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea)","series":"C1a (interim)"},{"area":"Greater North Sea","series":"C1b (interim)"}],"graph_notes":[{"note":null,"series":"C1a (interim)"},{"note":"Data are presented as 5-year moving average time periods because annual data may show strong variation due to smaller sample size or other reasons.","series":"C1b (interim)"}],"graph_sources":[{"series":"C1a (interim)","source":"Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science"},{"series":"C1b (interim)","source":"Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; Wageningen University"}],"graph_titles":[{"series":"C1a (interim)","title":"C1a (interim): Items of litter per 100m of beach, UK, 2008 to 2015"},{"series":"C1b (interim)","title":"C1b (interim): Percentage of sampled fulmars having more than 0.1g of plastic in their stomach, Greater North Sea, 2004-2008 to 2015-2019"}],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Clean seas: marine litter","indicator_reference":"C1","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 14</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"UK (Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea)","oif_headline":"Not applicable","oif_indicator_status":"Interim","oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Minimising waste"],"oif_relevant_target":["Significantly reducing and where possible preventing all kinds of marine plastic pollution \u2013 in particular material that came originally from land"],"oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","published":false,"reporting_status":"Interim","source_active_1":true,"title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator of clean seas shows changes in the amount of litter in the marine environment, including litter on beaches, on the seafloor and floating litter. Beach litter surveys are completed annually or quarterly and cover a representative number of beaches. Data from trawl surveys, typically carried out for fish stock assessments, are used to monitor the amount of litter on the seafloor. After each tow all litter items are emptied from the net and counted and classified. Beached fulmars or individuals accidently killed are collected as part of a monitoring programme in the Greater North Sea to assess the plastics found in their stomachs. Fulmars forage exclusively at sea, generally at the surface of the water. The amount of plastic they ingest can be used as a proxy for the abundance of floating litter in their environment and how this is changing. Indicators for seafloor litter, beach litter and litter found in Fulmar stomachs have been developed and expert groups are working to improve the data. Additional monitoring programmes are being developed to record the amount of microplastics in sediment and in biota.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows 3 aspects of litter in the marine environment: a) beach litter b) plastic in fulmar stomachs and c) seafloor litter. The assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the updated [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marine-strategy-part-one-uk-updated-assessment-and-good-environmental-status). Data, analytical methods and assessments on [Marine litter](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/pressures-from-human-activities/marine-litter/) are available, as are [fulmar data from 2011-2015 to 2015-2019](https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/british-fulmars-confirm-decrease-in-plastic-debris.htm).\n\n[The litter dashboard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/litter-and-littering-in-england-data-dashboard?msclkid=cd7df99ad0fe11ecaebf69fb9f31334c) also includes some beach litter data beyond 2015 but this is not directly comparable to C1a. Additional commentary on recent trends in the C1b indicator is published in the [latest research report from Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en/newsarticle/british-fulmars-confirm-decrease-in-plastic-debris.htm) to Defra (Project code ME5227) which supports reporting commitments under OSPAR.\n\nFurther development of this indicator is required, and the indicator\u2019s format will evolve.\n\n## Note on Figures C1a, C1b and C1c\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessments of marine litter. They enable an understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description for Figures C1a, C1b and C1c\n\n### C1a) Beach litter\n\nThe average total abundance of beach litter items per 100m of coast varies considerably around the UK with greater quantities being recorded in the Celtic Seas than in the Greater North Sea. After showing some decrease from 2009 to 2011, beach litter levels in the Celtic Seas, whilst fluctuating, have risen to greater than the 2008 levels. In the Greater North Sea, there has been an increase in beach litter levels. Water currents, weather conditions, and prevailing wind conditions can have an influence on the deposition and retention of beach litter and therefore beach litter abundance. In all beach litter regions, the majority of litter items were made of plastic (including polystyrene). Plastic fragments are the most commonly found type of litter item, followed by food and drinks packaging, sewage related debris and then smaller amounts of fishing-related litter.\n\n### C1b) Fulmars\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014 approximately 60% of surveyed (beached) fulmars in the Greater North Sea region were found to have more than 0.1g of plastic (the threshold level used in the OSPAR target definition) in their stomachs. This reflects the abundance of floating litter in their environment. More recently, the measure appears to show some decline, but not to an extent that is statistically significant.\n\n### C1c) Seafloor litter\n\nFrom sampling UK seafloor litter to date higher amounts of litter and plastic have been found per km2 of seafloor in the Greater North Sea compared to the Celtic Seas. There were also higher amounts of seafloor litter in the southern parts of the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, which could be a result of increasing human pressures.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThe time series for interim C1a indicator Items of litter per 100m of beach runs from 2008 to 2015 which is not yet long enough to produce an assessment for medium and long-term time periods. A decrease in beach litter (or improvement) was observed in the Celtic Seas region over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2009 to 2014), but an increase (or deterioration) was observed in the Greater North Sea region.\n\nA decrease (or improvement) in the percentage of sampled fulmars which have more than 0.1g of plastic in their stomach was observed over the short, medium, and long-term time periods. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed for indicator components which had sufficient data. Little or no change in the fulmar indicator was observed since 2018. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nThe assessment results reported here are not directly comparable with other analyses published elsewhere that use different methodologies to explore these indicators or are based on alternative datasets.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table C1ai: Assessment of change in the number of litter items per 100m of beach, Celtic Seas\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2009-2014 | -9.6 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\n### Table C1aii: Assessment of change in the number of litter items per 100m of beach, Greater North Sea\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2009-2014 | +73.7 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\n### Table C1b: Assessment of change in the percentage of sampled fulmars having more than 0.1g of plastic in their stomach, Greater North Sea\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2010-2014 to 2015-2019 | -22.2 (moving average data) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2004-2009 to 2015-2019 | -24.6 (moving average data) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2004-2008 to 2015-2019 | -21.0 (moving average data) | Improvement |\n\nAssessment categories for indicator C1a were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables C1ai and C1aii may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in waste landfilled or incinerated (with and without energy recovery) in England, excluding major minerals. Some data are available via the Environment Agency\u2019s [Waste data interrogator](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/bb40d091-a346-4b75-aa54-df7d347bed93/2020-waste-data-interrogator) and [incineration monitoring reports](https://environment.data.gov.uk/portalstg/home/item.html?id=5f25d4693fe8499282070ea40e08d0a0), but further work is required to split these data by source sector.

However, it is intended for these to be incorporated in the future.\n\n## Trend description for Figure J4\n\nIn 2019, the total quantity of waste (excluding major mineral wastes) landfilled or incinerated in England was 29.1 million tonnes, a 5.0% reduction against levels in 2010 (30.6 million tonnes). This reduction was due to less waste being landfilled (falling by 44.1% over the period 2010 to 2019), and more waste being sent to incineration (increasing by 156.3% over the same period).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThe time series for interim J4 indicator Residual waste (excluding major mineral wastes) in England begins in 2010 which is not yet long enough to produce an assessment for medium and long-term time periods. The assessment shows trends for the total of both landfill and incineration waste. Missing data points for incineration waste were extrapolated to produce a continuous time series. A small increase in residual waste (or deterioration) was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018). This assessment does not consider whether this improvement is on a sufficient scale to meet any targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. An increase in residual waste has been observed since 2018.

It shows the percentage of designated bathing waters meeting conditions sufficient to minimise the risk of harm to bathers from faecal pollution. It is based on a set of microbiological tests (measuring *E.coli* and intestinal enterococci) performed on waters used for bathing. The bacteria, if present, can cause severe stomach upsets and gastro-intestinal illness. Bathing waters are mainly coastal beaches but also include a number of inland freshwater lakes and one area on a river.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on [Bathing water quality statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/bathing-water-quality-statistics) are already published annually; longer-term trends are available in the [State of the environment: water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment).\n\n## Note on Figure B4\n\nBathing waters in England were not classified in 2020 due to the severe impacts on bathing water monitoring and analysis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary adherence with government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n## Trend description for Figure B4\n\nThe number of designated bathing waters in England meeting at least the minimum standard (sufficient, good or excellent) has increased considerably from 45.7% in 1995 to 99% in 2021. The majority of this increase occurred in the period to 2015; since then, the number meeting at least the minimum standard has remained relatively stable at between 97.1% and 99%. The number of bathing waters achieving excellent status has also increased considerably since 1995, with 70.7% meeting this standard in 2021. The number of bathing waters rated as poor has remained below 3% since 2015 (1% in 2021).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nAn assessment was undertaken using the B4 indicator to look at change in the percent of designated bathing waters meeting minimum standards of at least sufficient condition. A small increase (or improvement) in this metric was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020). A new method was introduced in 2015, so only data from that year onwards were included in the assessment. The new method is not directly comparable to the old method, so it is not appropriate to look at trends across both datasets. This meant there was not a sufficiently long time series for a medium or long-term assessment.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in the condition of bathing waters since 2018 with no reported data for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The assessment is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend. It should also be noted that in 2018 nearly 98% of designated bathing waters were already in at least sufficient condition so there is little scope for further improvement in this indicator.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

Waste crime is a broad term encompassing fly-tipping, illegal waste sites, illegal waste exports, the misdescription of waste and illegal waste dumping, among other illegal waste-related activities. If not handled properly, waste can cause serious pollution of the environment \u2013 air, land and water, which can also be harmful to health. It further reduces the availability of resources from waste. Current data reported include illegal waste sites and fly-tipping. The underpinning data can be used to establish the level of criminal activity for some aspects of waste crime and geographic distribution. Options for further development will be considered, including the impacts and behavioural aspects of waste crime, the amount and types of potential resources lost through waste crime, and to reflect the need for targeting and effective enforcement to deliver reductions in the level of criminal activities.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the number of: (a) illegal waste sites and (b) fly-tipping incidents in England. Some data on [illegal waste sites (waste crime)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-2020-data-on-regulated-businesses-in-england) and [fly-tipping](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england) are already published, but further work is required to develop the final indicator.\n\n## Trend description for Figures J6a and J6b\n\n### J6a) Illegal waste sites\n\nThe total number of illegal waste sites in England fell from a peak of 1,011 active sites in the financial year 2011/2012 to 556 active sites in 2013/2014. Since then, the number increased gradually, reaching 685 sites in 2018/2019, before falling again to 470 sites in 2020/2021. Within this total, the number of active high-risk illegal waste sites fell by 44% from a peak of 353 sites in 2012/2013 to 197 sites in 2020/2021.\n\n### J6b) Fly-tipping incidents\n\nThe total number of fly-tipping incidents reported in England fell from 1.28 million incidents in the financial year 2007/2008 to 715,000 incidents in 2012/2013. Since these initial reductions, the number of incidents reported under the old methodology increased to over 1 million (1.07 million) between 2012/2013 and 2018/2019. The total number of fly-tipping incidents reported in 2018/2019 under the new methodology was 957,000. In the 2 years to 2020/2021, this total increased by 18.5% to 1.13 million incidents.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThere has been an improvement recorded over the medium term for both interim indicators for J6: J6a Illegal waste sites in England and J6b Fly-tipping incidents in England. However, in the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2012 to 2017), fly tipping incidents have begun to increase again (meaning a deterioration for the indicator) and progress has stalled for illegal waste sites with an assessment of \u2018little or no change\u2019.\n\nThe time series for both J6 indicator component\u2019s are not yet long enough for a long-term assessment. A new methodology was introduced in 2018 for J6b but, as this was not directly comparable to the previous method and only 3 data points are so far available, just data based on the old method were included in the assessment.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Illegal waste sites decreased in 2019 (an improvement) while fly tipping incident increased (a deterioration). However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table J6a: Assessment of change in the total number of active illegal waste sites in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -1.4 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -14.7 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\n### Table J6b: Assessment of change in the number of fly-tipping incidents in England (using old methodology)\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +36.0 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -22.0 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\nNote that assessment categories were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables J6a and J6b may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

PANS began collecting data on an on-going basis from 2 April 2020 and can now report on this interim indicator after one year of data collection (up to 31 March 2021). Further information on PANS survey methods, outputs and the full questionnaires, are available on the [PANS homepage](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england#monthly-interim-indicators). The PANS team welcome collaboration and feedback via the [PANS user hub](https://people-and-nature-survey-defra.hub.arcgis.com/).\n\nSimilar data for children from the [Children\u2019s People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics) (C-PANS) will be included in the 2023 Outcome Indicator Framework report.\n\nThis interim indicator may be superseded following an assessment of more appropriate national data to evidence the health and well-being implications of improvements in quality, access to and engagement with England\u2019s natural environments.\n\n## Trend description for Figure G7\n\nThe PANS survey cannot yet show yearly trends. However, data from 2020/2021 show that, the majority (94%) of adults who had visited green and natural spaces in the last 14 days felt that spending time outdoors was good for their physical health, and 92% thought it was good for their mental health.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"7.7.1","target_id":"7.7","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-07-01"},"2-3-1":{"computation_units":null,"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"B3a (interim)","units":"Percentage of water bodies assessed"},{"series":"B3b (interim)","units":"Percentage of water bodies assessed"},{"series":"B3c (interim)","units":"Percentage of area"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values_by_series":[{"field":"Component","series":"B3a (interim)","value":"Biology"},{"field":"Component","series":"B3a (interim)","value":"Ecological status"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3a (interim)","value":"not at good status"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3a (interim)","value":"at good status"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3a (interim)","value":"other"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3b (interim)","value":"Not at good status"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3b (interim)","value":"At good status"},{"field":"Component","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites"},{"field":"Component","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"Drinking water protected areas"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"at risk"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"not at risk"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"favourable"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"unfavourable recovering"},{"field":"Status category","series":"B3c (interim)","value":"other"}],"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_category_color":{"B3a (interim)":{"Biology, at good status":"#3F94DE","Biology, not at good status":"#e1e1e1","Ecological status, at good status":"#12436D","Ecological status, other":"#808080"},"B3b (interim)":{"At good status":"#12436D","Not at good status":"#e1e1e1"},"B3c (interim)":{"Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites, favourable":"#12436D","Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites, other":"#e1e1e1","Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites, unfavourable recovering":"#3F94DE","Drinking water protected areas, at risk":"#808080","Drinking water protected areas, not at risk":"#801650"}},"graph_category_order":{"B3a (interim)":{"Biology, at good status":0,"Biology, not at good status":1,"Ecological status, at good status":0,"Ecological status, other":1},"B3b (interim)":{"At good status":0,"Not at good status":1},"B3c (interim)":{"Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites, favourable":0,"Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites, other":2,"Condition of SSSI units underpinning European protected water and wetland sites, unfavourable recovering":1,"Drinking water protected areas, at risk":1,"Drinking water protected areas, not at risk":0}},"graph_notes":[{"note":"Results are based on the numbers of water bodies assessed and represent the achievement of good or better status.

The indicator comprises several metrics including percentage of water tests meeting good (or better) status for ecology and chemistry, percentage of water bodies achieving good ecological status, and compliance of waters specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and nature conservation. \u2018Status\u2019 refers to quality as measured under the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 (the WFD Regulations). Some of these data relating to protected sites are also included in indicator \u2018D2 Extent and condition of protected sites \u2013 land, water and sea\u2019.

A revised interim indicator is presented here as an experimental statistic that was first presented in 2021. It includes metrics from the WFD Regulations status tests for (a) surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters) and (b) groundwaters; as well as additional metrics for (c) waters protected for a specific reason such as drinking waters and nature sites. For each water type, we include a representative element that is tested to assess the condition of a water body, reflecting water quality and/or hydromorphology (the physical character and water content in water bodies). There are many more elements assessed and tests undertaken; the data represent a snapshot of the complete WFD Regulations dataset. There are no new assessments included in the 2022 report.\n\nSupporting detail for each of the water types and a more detailed dashboard of data are available on the updated [B3 Evidence Pages](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-water-environment-indicator-b3-supporting-evidence). These data have been published as an experimental statistic to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator.\n\nWe would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk).\n\nFurther work is required to develop the indicator which may, for example, show change over time. We will continue to work with partners to develop our approach for future reporting. Data and evidence will begin to come from different sources as Environment Agency monitoring networks are updated as part of the Natural Capital Ecosystem Assessment development. Piloting and rollout of new networks has begun, and data will start to feed into indicator reporting from 2023. Existing source data are currently published ([WFD element status ,](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4d28e5c2-dc05-4945-9574-002fa71db22f/wfd-cycle-2-overall-classification) [protected area data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/river-basin-management-plans-national-evidence-and-data-report), [State of the environment and the water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment)).\n\n## Trend description for Figures B3a, B3b and B3c\n\n### B3a) Surface waters (including rivers, lakes, estuaries and coasts)\n\nIn total, 16% of surface water bodies met all the relevant criteria of the WFD Regulations in 2019. For rivers, invertebrates and the combined test for macrophytes and phytobenthos (plants and algae) are reported to indicate biological quality, where 76% and 45% of tests carried out passed for the water bodies assessed, respectively. For lakes, the representative biological element shown is phytoplankton with 52% of water bodies assessed passing. For estuaries and coasts saltmarsh is used to reflect the extent and quality of habitat; results show 36% and 50% of water bodies monitored pass the test, respectively.\n\n### B3b) Groundwaters\n\nIn 2019, 75% of groundwaters passed quantitative tests and 45% passed chemical (qualitative) tests.\n\n### B3c) Sites specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and nature conservation\n\nIn 2019 to 2020, 52% of surface water and 53% of groundwater areas (sites) protected for drinking water abstraction were assessed as not being at risk of deterioration. For protected nature sites, 46% were in favourable condition and 47% were in an unfavourable but recovering condition in 2019.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"2.3.1","target_id":"2.3","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-03-01","graph_title":"State of the water environment"},"5-4-1":{"computation_units":"Index (1973 = 100)","data_non_statistical":false,"data_footnote":null,"graph_notes":null,"data_show_map":false,"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_annotations":[{"preset":"base_line","series":""}],"graph_title":"E4 (interim): Efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity in the UK, 1973 to 2020","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity","indicator_reference":"E4","national_geographical_coverage":"UK","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>None</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"England.

It is based on the ratio of inputs (indicator \u2018E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production\u2019) to outputs (indicator \u2018E2 Volume of agricultural production\u2019) such that the higher the value, the more efficiently inputs are converted into outputs. Data are based on volumes rather than values so that price effects are removed. The measure is known as Total Factor Productivity as it takes into account all output and input factors, including land, labour, intermediate consumption and depreciation of capital.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the total factor productivity for the UK. Data on [total factor productivity for England by farm type](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-for-england-by-farm-type) are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on [total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-of-the-agricultural-industry) is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description for Figure E4\n\nOverall productivity is driven by both the output and input components. Total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK was 54% higher in 2020 than it was in 1973. There has been an overall long-term increase driven by both increased outputs and a fall in inputs, although the separate trends (see indicators E2 and E3) have followed different patterns. There is considerable annual variation, this variation being mainly driven by variation in output volumes, and over the most recent year (2020), total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK fell by 4.5%.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change in efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019). This is in contrast to increasing trends in the medium and long term. It is not possible to simplistically categorise any change as either an \u2018improvement\u2019 or \u2018deterioration\u2019 for the environment as this will depend on the farming practices driving change.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed.

Fish are a good indicator of healthy freshwater environments, responding to changes in water quality (including temperature) and quantity, as well as the quality of river habitats, necessary to sustain healthy populations and enable migration throughout rivers to allow fish to complete their life cycles. Fish also provide an important recreational and economic benefit from freshwaters.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (a) the proportion of principal salmon rivers at risk in England and, additionally, (b) the classification of fish species within English rivers. B7a presents annually published [national salmon stock data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonid-and-freshwater-fisheries-statistics-2019). For this assessment, each river\u2019s salmon stocks are placed into one of 4 categories: at risk; probably at risk; probably not at risk; and not at risk. The results act as a proxy for whether a particular river is at risk or not. In addition, a second measure of freshwater health was included for the first time in 2021. [Fish classification data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4d28e5c2-dc05-4945-9574-002fa71db22f/wfd-cycle-2-overall-classification) for B7b reflect the status of fish populations within rivers assessed in England. The results show whether the status of a particular river is high; good; moderate; poor or bad for fish. These data contribute to the assessment of ecological status in rivers (B3a). Further work will examine the coverage of the indicator.\n\n## Trend description for Figures B7a and B7b\n\n### B7a) Salmon stock status\n\nThe overall status of salmon stocks across principal salmon rivers continues to show a decline over the period of this assessment. This continues a trend observed before the start of the time series (2006). The percentage of rivers in the 'not at risk' category fell from 21% in 2006 to 0% in 2014 where it remained until there was a slight (2 percentage point) recovery in 2020. The percentage of rivers that are probably not at risk has fallen by 9 percentage points over the 15 years covered by this indicator. The percentage of principal salmon rivers at risk in England has fluctuated considerably from year to year; but overall, the percentage at risk in 2020 (48%) was 10 percentage points higher than the equivalent figure for 2006 (38%). The percentage of rivers in the 'probably at risk' category has also increased over the same time period (by 19 percentage points, from 21% to 40%).\n\n### B7b) Classification of fish\n\nThe data show a slight but consistent increase in the numbers of rivers classed as high and good ecological status for fish between 2009 and 2015 and a corresponding small decrease in numbers of rivers in the poor and bad categories. Indications are that there was no change in the proportions of rivers in the 5 different categories between 2016 and 2019. From 2015, a revised method for assessing status was introduced and there are not yet sufficient data points to assess a trend. The new method is not directly comparable to the old method, so it is not appropriate to assess trend across both datasets at this time.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nA decrease (or deterioration) for the principal salmon rivers classed as \u2018Not at risk\u2019 or \u2018Probably at risk\u2019 was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), as well as over the medium and long term. This indicator is derived from highly variable data as fish are susceptible to yearly weather patterns and have natural cycles in abundance. This reduces confidence that shorter-term assessment results reflect real trends rather than natural variation. A more marked deterioration is evident over the medium term, reflecting a steep drop after 2012.\n\nAn increase (or improvement) has been observed for the percent of English rivers classified as in high or good status based on fish, over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2009 to 2014). From 2015, a new method was introduced for assessing status and there are not yet sufficient data points to assess a trend. The new method is not directly comparable to the old method, so it is not appropriate to look at trends across both datasets. When a suitable time series is built up with the new method, this more recent data will be assessed. There is not a sufficiently long time series for making an assessment over the medium and long-term periods.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there has been an increase (or improvement) for the indicator for principal salmon rivers classed as \u2018Not at risk\u2019 or \u2018Probably at risk\u2019. However, this improvement is slight and is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend. Insufficient data are available to assess change since 2018 for classification of fish in English rivers.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table B7a: Assessment of change in salmon stock status \u2013 principal salmon rivers at risk in England (not at risk or probably not at risk)\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2014-2019 | -55.2 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | 2009-2019 | -81.5 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Long term | 2006-2019 | -76.2 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table B7b: Assessment of change in the classification of fish in English rivers (high or good)\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2009-2014 | +16.1 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\nNote that assessment categories for the short, medium and long term were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables B7a and B7b may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

GHGs emitted directly by households (making up 21.0% of the footprint in 2018) were 9.6% lower in 2018 than in 2001 as a result of reductions in emissions associated with household-related heating. Total consumption-based emissions have been on a downward trajectory since 2004: the greatest contribution to this trend has come from the goods and services produced in England and consumed here; but emissions embedded in imports have also reduced substantially (36.3% and 33.7% respectively from the 2004 peak overall). As a proportion of total emissions in 2018, GHGs emitted overseas in the production of goods and services consumed in England made up 42.7% of the total footprint.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThe interim indicator for J1 \u2018Consumption based greenhouse gas emissions in England\u2019 was assessed. This showed an improvement in the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), and over the medium and long-term time periods. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

These include our Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Ramsar sites. These area designations have been included as they focus on the protection of biodiversity and provide legal mechanisms for this protection. This indicator currently has 2 components: (a) extent of protected sites on land, freshwater and at sea and (b) condition of terrestrial SSSIs on land and water. Condition for terrestrial sites is assessed against relevant common standards agreed by the UK conservation agencies. Condition methodology for marine sites is currently under development.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for publishing in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the extent of protected areas (D2a) and condition of SSSIs (D2b) in England. Data for this interim indicator are published annually as [England Biodiversity Indicator 1 \u2013 Extent and condition of protected areas](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Work is underway to review reporting for terrestrial and freshwater sites. Further work is required to implement a methodology for assessing the condition of marine sites.\n\n## Note on Figures D2a and D2b\n\nThe figures presented in this indicator differ from the England element of the [UK Biodiversity Indicator C1 \u2013 Protected Areas](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-c1-protected-areas/), which includes additional area designations (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks) that are not included here.\n\n## Trend description for Figures D2a and D2b\n\n### D2a) Extent of Protected sites\n\nThe total extent of land, water and sea protected in England through national and international protected areas increased from 1.2 million hectares in 1999 to 3.5 million hectares in 2021. The area of sites at sea has increased substantially, by more than 8 times since the time series began in 1999 although the majority of this increase took place between 2011 and 2020. The area of sites on land and water has remained relatively stable over time, increasing by 7% between 1999 and 2021.\n\n### D2b) Condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest\n\nThere has been a net decrease in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition; down from 44% in 2003 to 38.4% in 2021. The sudden drop in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition from 43.2% in 2010 to 36.6% in 2011 was largely due to a more rigorous application of the \u2018Common Standard for Monitoring\u2019 protocols in assessing unit condition. While there has been a small increase in the area in favourable condition over the last 10 years (from 36.6% in 2011 to 38.4% in 2021), the figure has fallen slightly in the latest year. The area of SSSIs in unfavourable recovering condition has increased substantially from 13% in 2003 to 53% in 2021.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the extent of protected sites on land and water in England over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2016 to 2021), or the medium term. An increase (or improvement) was observed over the long-term time period. The has been an increase in the extent of protected sites at sea in England over the short, medium and long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvements seen are on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nThere has been little or no change in the percentage of SSSIs in England achieving favourable condition over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2016 to 2021). An increase (or improvement) was observed over the medium term, while there has been a long-term decrease (deterioration).\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there has been little or no change in extent of protected sites on land and water or the percent of SSSIs achieving favourable status. However, extent of protected sites at sea has increased. This is based on 4 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

Protected areas are a key tool for conserving the globally significant and, in many cases endemic, biodiversity found in the Territories. This indicator will have 2 components: (a) extent and (b) condition of UKOT protected areas. It will show changes in the coverage of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) across the UKOTs, from a 2020 baseline. The baseline is calculated using UKOT protected area extent data provided by UKOT governments. The areas are aggregated across UKOTs and geographical regions and percent coverage is calculated for the land and marine environments separately. The indicator will also demonstrate the condition of protected areas in the UKOTs, using aspects of protected area condition that can be assessed cost-effectively.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the extent of protected areas and OECMs across the UKOTs. Information on how the data have been obtained and how the statistics have been calculated is available in [JNCC Report Number 704](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.jncc.gov.uk%2Fassets%2Fd7207246-4903-4e87-9c19-65cf016accd5&data=05%7C01%7CCallum.Fry%40defra.gov.uk%7C39e101984efc49694e3408da24740767%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637862378017315543%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=KmrsjWuYF3xDI4m1TNVRnDv9TQEIYs6g%2Bl58XgcKsqk%3D&reserved=0). The data are being published as experimental statistics in order to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator.\n\nWe would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk).\n\nDevelopment of the condition aspect of this indicator has begun, exploring the feasibility of assessing terrestrial protected area condition and using 4 UKOTs as case studies to assess options for marine protected area condition.\n\n## Note on Figure K4\n\n\u2018All UKOTs\u2019 (results presented in bold on the chart) includes 13 UK Overseas Territories; the British Antarctic Territory is not included.\u2018Mediterranean\u2019 includes the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and Gibraltar. \u2018Indian and Pacific Oceans\u2019 includes British Indian Ocean Territory and Pitcairn Islands group. \u2018South Atlantic\u2019 includes the Falkland Islands, St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. \u2018Wider Caribbean\u2019 includes Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nThe indicator includes protected areas and OECMs formally established up to and during December 2021, where these are implemented for and/or deliver biodiversity conservation. There is a wide range of protected area designation types within and across the UKOTs; the data reported represent the UKOT governments\u2019 views on the composition of their respective protected area networks. Extent is measured using the outer boundaries of sites; the indicator does not assess the extent of management measures within protected areas and OECMs. UK Hydrographic Office data are used to map UK Overseas Territories\u2019 seas in the absence of formally agreed maritime boundaries.\n\nA Marine Protection Zone covering 687,223 km2 of Tristan da Cunha\u2019s waters was formally designated in August 2021, this site has substantially increased marine protected area coverage across all UKOTs and within the South Atlantic region. A suite of new inshore marine protected areas were also designated in the Cayman Islands in March 2021.\n\n## Trend description for Figure K4\n\nAs of the end of December 2021, protected areas and OECMs covered three-quarters (75%) of the marine environment in the UKOTs (up from 63% in 2020), but a much smaller proportion (4.7%) of the terrestrial environment (no change since 2020). Given the UKOTs\u2019 combined marine area is more than 300 times larger than the land area (approximately 5,748,600 km2 of sea compared to 17,738 km2 of land), the extent of marine protection (4,308,659 km2) is also 4 orders of magnitude larger than for the terrestrial environment (832 km2). There are marked differences in protected area coverage between regions, with the 2 UKOTs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans protecting the greatest proportions of the terrestrial and marine environment (collectively) compared to other regions.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"10.4.1","target_id":"10.4","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-04-01"},"3-11-1":{"computation_units":"Percentage of species","data_footnote":"Based on the assessment results for 55 sensitive fish species found in fisheries surveys of the Greater North Sea.

The indicator is linked to the UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 1 (biodiversity) and the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows [assessments of change in occurrence of 55 sensitive fish species](https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=38040) in international scientific surveys of the Greater North Sea. Species are assessed for evidence of a significant increase or decrease in frequency of occurrence in the assessment period (2015 to 2020) compared to a reference period. There is an aspiration to reverse any long-term depletion of species populations, so the basis of the assessment is a long-term reference period inclusive of all years prior to the assessment period (that is 1967 to 2014). To identify whether depletion is ongoing or if signs of recovery are evident, a secondary short-term reference period is also defined (here, 2009 to 2014).\n\nFurther work to standardise the dataset is ongoing due to a change in the types of fishing equipment used to conduct the surveys over time.\n\nThe indicator provides an assessment of change in the occurrence of species identified as sensitive to fishing. Where data allow, those species that fail this occurrence assessment will be analysed further to identify any change in abundance and condition (population age and size structure) (see [Bluemel et al.*,* 2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356059363_Decline_in_Atlantic_wolffish_Anarhichas_lupus_in_the_North_Sea_Impacts_of_fishing_pressure_and_climate_change) for a comprehensive example using this methodology).\n\n## Note on Figure C11\n\nThese results were produced as part of the worked example of a sensitive fish species presence-absence analysis, as conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea workshop on the abundance estimates for sensitive species (WKABSENS).\n\nThe inclusion of incomplete survey data from the 1960s to 1980s can be important to track the true status of rare species, despite several limitations, which are detailed in the [WKABSENS Report](https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Forms/DispForm.aspx?ID=38040).\n\n## Trend description for Figure C11\n\nOver the long term, 16 (33%) of the 48 species assessed show a significant decline in occurrence in the assessment period (2015 to 2020) compared to the long-term reference period (1967 to 2008), whereas in the short term, only 11 (22%) of the 51 species assessed show a significant decline in the assessment period compared to the short-term reference period (2009 to 2014).\n\nA further 27 (56%) of the species assessed show a significant increase in occurrence in the assessment period compared to the long-term reference period, very similar to the number of species (29 or 57% of those assessed) that show a significant increase in the assessment period compared to the short-term reference period.\n\nThe suite of sensitive fish species assessed by this indicator for the Greater North Sea (OSPAR region II) would not achieve an aggregated assessment result consistent with Good Environmental Status because the total number of decreasing species (16) over the long term is significantly high (and above the number expected by chance at the 5% significance level).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"3.11.1","target_id":"3.11","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-11-01"},"7-5-1":{"computation_units":"Index (2000 = 100)","data_footnote":"Some data have been imputed to fill gaps in the time series where contributing organisations were unable to provide figures for a particular year.<br/><br/>Data provided by 6 organisations (The Conservation Volunteers, Canal and River Trust (formerly British Waterways), National Parks England, Natural England, RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts) were for financial years rather than calendar years.

An interim indicator is provided here that presents data from [England biodiversity indicator 14 \u2013 Taking action for the environment](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). These data show volunteer time spent on activities of benefit to the natural environment in England. While the impacts of COVID-19 on the volunteering sector are likely to be considerable, they are not reflected in the results of this interim indicator because the most recently available data from the England biodiversity indicators (to 31 March 2020) mostly predate the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nInformation on social action for the environment is now also collected through Natural England\u2019s nationally representative [People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england) (PANS) and the [Children\u2019s People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics) (C-PANS). PANS began collecting data on an ongoing basis from 2 April 2020 and C-PANS has measured social action for the environment during school holiday-time (10 to 31 August) and is due to release data from a 2021 term-time survey. Further information on the survey methods, outputs and the full questionnaires, are available on the [PANS homepage](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england#monthly-interim-indicators).

Scrutiny of the multiple questions relating to social action for the environment to assess how they should be used and whether a composite score can be used for the purposes of this indicator.\n2. On-going collection of data past year 1 to allow for examination of trends over time.\n3. Work to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on the trends for this indicator.\n\n## Trend description for Figure G5\n\nBetween 2000 and 2019, the index of the amount of time contributed by environmental volunteers in England has fluctuated, but, overall, it has increased by 42%.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nFuture Outcome Indicator Framework reports will present data from PANS on people engaged in social action for the environment. When a sufficient time series is available, we will make an assessment using this new indicator. In the meantime, only the interim indicator on volunteer time spent on the natural environment has been assessed. An increase (or improvement) was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as over the medium and long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. A decrease (or deterioration) in volunteer time spent on the natural environment was observed since 2018 (up to 2019).

The damaging nutrient nitrogen comes predominantly from ammonia (NH3) but partly nitrogen oxides (NOX) and long-range transport of air pollutants.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as pressure on thriving plants and wildlife. It is determined by calculating the area of sensitive habitat exceeding the internationally agreed threshold for likely damaging effects from reactive nitrogen deposition in both oxidised and reduced forms, termed the critical load. It uses modelled interpolations of atmospheric concentrations of NOX and NH3 and models deposition processes based on internationally agreed methodology.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nAssessments of nutrient nitrogen deposition are undertaken and published annually using 3-year moving average data, at [UK Air Information Resource: Trends in critical load and critical level exceedances in the UK](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/reports?report_id=1020).\n\n## Trend description for Figure A6\n\nThe percentage area of sensitive habitats in England where nutrient nitrogen deposition exceeded critical load has fallen over the latest 23 years for which data are available (98.3% in 1995 to 1997 to 95.6% in 2017 to 2019), although it has increased slightly over the last 3 data points (94.8% in 2015 to 2017 to 95.6% in 2017 to 2019).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThere has been little or no change observed in exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2012-2014 to 2017-2019), or over the medium and long-term time periods.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed.

Air pollution has negative impacts on human health and the environment. Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. As well as being emitted directly, particulate matter can be formed in the atmosphere from reactions between other pollutants, of which SO2, NOX, NMVOCs and NH3 are the most important. NOX and NH3 emissions can be deposited in soils or in rivers and lakes, for example, through rain. Resulting nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses and by producing ozone (O3) which damages crops and leads to impacts on wildlife through enhanced nutrient levels.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of pressures on the atmosphere caused by the emissions of 5 key pollutants, which when concentrated in the air or deposited have impacts on human health and ecosystems.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nEmissions data are published annually in the [Air Quality Pollutant Inventories 2005-2019](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1030).\n\n## Note on Figure A1\n\nConsultation with the devolved administrations led to the agreement to limit updates to historic devolved administration air pollutant inventories to 2005 as this is the base year for legally binding emissions reductions commitments. This also allows more resource to be allocated to the development of more recent years of the time series for which there is better access to updated methods and data. A [UK-wide historic time series of emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/emissions-of-air-pollutants) remains available back to 1970, published as part of Defra\u2019s annual emissions reporting each February.\n\n## Trend description for Figure A1\n\nEmissions for all 5 key air pollutants (ammonia, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide) in England have fallen over the latest 15 years for which annual, country-level data are available. Emissions of SO2 have seen the greatest reductions, falling by 80% between 2005 and 2019. Emissions of NOx and NMVOCs and have also fallen considerably, by 53% and 37% respectively; emissions of PM2.5 and NH3 have fallen by 15% and 3% respectively over the same period.\n\nMore recently, the trends in annual emissions of PM2.5 and NMVOC have levelled off and emissions of NH3 have increased. For PM2.5, decreases in emissions from many sources have been partially offset by increases in emissions from residential burning (domestic combustion); emissions of PM2.5 from this source increased by 66% between 2005 and 2019.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nFour of the air pollutants measured by the A1 indicator have shown an improvement in the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), and over the medium and long-term time periods. However, emissions of NH3 have been increasing over the short and medium term. More detailed reporting mentioned in the \u2018Readiness and links to data\u2019 section for this indicator may provide insights into the factors behind this change in NH3 emissions. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. [Projections towards air emissions targets](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/overview/making-projections) set at a UK scale are available to supplement this assessment.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. SO2 and NOx emissions showed an improvement in 2019, while NH3, NMVOC and PM2.5 emissions showed little or no change. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

The indicator shows the number of events in each year that are in the 2 higher categories (category 1, major and category 2, significant), for example, causing death of fish, potential harm to bathers, or the temporary cessation of abstraction from a river by a drinking water provider.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published annually by the Environment Agency.\n\n* [Pollution incidents data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-2020-data-on-regulated-businesses-in-england)\n* [Section 5 of the Water and Sewerage Companies in England environmental performance report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-and-sewerage-companies-in-england-environmental-performance-report-2020)\n\nLonger-term trends are available in the [State of the environment: water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment) and the [Regulating for people, the environment and growth report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-for-people-the-environment-and-growth-2020).\n\n## Note on Figure B2\n\nSome incidents may take an extended period of months, or exceptionally years, to be completed.\n\nThe dataset only includes substantiated incidents and their environmental impact, that is where there is confirmation that the incident took place either by a visit from the Environment Agency or a partner organisation, or it is corroborated by other information.\n\nResults do not include incidents relating to:\n\n* Fisheries incidents \u2013 incidents involving illegal fishing and illegal fish movements, fish disease, fishery management activities and fish kills from non-pollution causes, including low flows and low dissolved oxygen\n* Water Resources incidents \u2013 incidents involving the quantity of a water resource.\n* Waterways incidents \u2013 incidents on a waterway where the Environment Agency are the competent authority for navigation\n* Flood and Coastal Risk Management incidents \u2013 for incidents which involve actual or potential flooding and land drainage works\n\n## Trend description for Figure B2\n\nThe total number of serious pollution incidents to water in England has fallen by almost two-thirds (62%) between 2001 and 2020, with the majority of this fall occurring in the first 10 years (834 in 2001 and 337 in 2010). More recently, while there have been annual fluctuations in the numbers of category 1 (major) and category 2 (significant) pollution incidents in the last 10 years, the overall trend has plateaued, and in 2020, there were a total of 317 serious pollution incidents to water (47 major and 270 significant).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nA decrease in serious pollution incidents (or improvement) was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as over the medium and long term. However, as noted in the trend description, the percentage change seen over the short and medium term is much reduced compared with the long term and there are fluctuations year on year. This assessment does not consider whether any improvements seen are on a sufficient scale for meeting desired outcomes.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in serious pollution incidents to water since 2018. However, this is based on 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

The municipal waste recycling rate is the fraction of household waste and waste similar in nature and composition to household waste, which is recycled. The indicator reflects levels of everyday waste that is recycled and not sent for final disposal. Development of the Defra \u2018waste tracking\u2019 tool and further integration with data collected by local authorities will close some of the data gaps and enable collection of more comprehensive data.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in \u2018[household waste\u2019 and \u2018waste from households\u2019 recycling rates](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results). These [waste data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env18-local-authority-collected-waste-annual-results-tables) are already published annually as National Statistics. Further development is required to include waste that is similar in nature and composition to household waste such as non-household municipal waste.

As this was not directly comparable to the previous method, we have only assessed trends using data following the new method. This limits the length of time series available, so no assessment is provided for medium and long-term time periods.\n\nLittle or no change was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020). This is in contrast to historic improvements recorded using the old method.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in municipal recycling rates since 2018, based on 4 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

Heritage features enable us to understand how our landscapes have been formed and are an important aspect of landscape character that significantly contribute to our enjoyment and appreciation of the natural beauty. We have a particular responsibility to conserve heritage features of designated sites. The indicator uses information from SSSI condition assessments and information which supports the production of Historic England\u2019s annual Heritage at Risk Register.\n\nAll geological (including geomorphological) features designated as SSSIs have first been subject to rigorous and systematic scientific assessment leading to their selection as nationally important Geological Conservation Review (GCR) sites. As of December 2021, there were 1,150 SSSIs in England designated wholly, or in part, for their geology, encompassing 1,679 features identified through the GCR. Many SSSIs contain more than one geological heritage feature.\n\nMonuments designated as Scheduled Monuments have been recognised by the Secretary of State as being nationally important. For a monument to be considered of national importance its surviving features, above and/or below the surface of the land or seabed, must have a particular significance that relates to its historic, traditional, architectural, artistic and/or archaeological interest. As of August 2021, there were 19,921 Scheduled Monuments in England.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are available on [SSSI condition assessments](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx) (as a searchable database), and as a data download of SSSI Monitored features. A programme of work was initiated in 2020, aimed at assessing the condition of previously unassessed geological features and reassessing the condition of features which have not been assessed for more than 6 years.\n\nData on [Scheduled Monuments at risk](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage-at-risk/) are also available. These data have been collated over an extended time period as it is not currently possible to update them in full on a regular basis. It should be noted that during 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted upon data collection and collation, and depending on the region, site visits for assessment purposes were either not possible or very limited. Although the usual level of on-site checking of entries on, additions to and removals from the Heritage at Risk Register was not possible, desk-based assessments and updates were carried out.\n\n## Note on Figures G2a and G2b\n\nThe observed increase in the percentage of geological and geomorphological heritage features in favourable condition from 2019 to 2021 and the absence of any major changes to the percentage of features in the unfavourable assessment categories over the same period is largely due to the timing of data inputted since the last update of this indicator. Most new assessments in favourable condition have been included in the 2021 results, whereas most unfavourable assessments are still being finalised and have therefore not been included yet. The resulting skew towards the percentage of heritage features in favourable condition relative to those in unfavourable condition should be resolved during the next scheduled update of this indicator in 2024, and current results for the unfavourable condition categories should be treated with caution.\n\nData on the condition of Scheduled Monuments in this indicator are based on archaeology assessments only. As of August 2021, 842 Scheduled Monuments have additional\ncondition assessments based on their built or structural remains; these have been omitted from this indicator.\n\n## Trend description for Figures G2a and G2b\n\n### G2a) Condition of geological and geomorphological heritage features of Sites of Special Scientific Interest\n\nIn total, 72% of all designated geological features have been assessed as in favourable condition as of December 2021 (a 12 percentage point increase in the equivalent figure for 2019) and a further 7% have been assessed as unfavourable but recovering.

Ambitious reductions in water consumption and leakage have a significant role in maintaining secure supplies and protecting the environment. This indicator shows changes in the efficient use of water, focussing on (a) leakage and (b) per capita consumption. Leakage and per capita household consumption of water in England are existing metrics reported to The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and the Environment Agency.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nWater companies in England and Wales report total [leakage and per capita household consumption figures](https://www.discoverwater.co.uk/) annually as 3-year moving averages, but it should be noted that these totals differ from the England-only data presented in this indicator due to the inclusion of results for Wales. From 2020, water companies report their leakage performance against Ofwat\u2019s 2025 target, this is a 3-year average with 2017 to 2018 as a start point for the 3-year average.\n\n## Trend description for Figures E8a and E8b\n\n### E8a) Water leakage\n\nBetween 2018 to 2019 and 2020 to 2021, total water leakage in England averaged 2,857 megalitres per day, 9% lower than the daily average for the 3 years from 2000-2001 to 2002-2003.\n\n### E8b) Per capita water consumption\n\nPer capita household water consumption has also fallen during the time period covered by this indicator, from an average of 152 litres per person per day in the 3 years to 2003/2004 to an average of 145 litres per person per day in the most recent 3-year time period (2018/2019 to 2020/2021).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for water leakage in England (E8a) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (3-year moving average time periods ending 2015/2016 to 2020/2021). This is in contrast to historic improvements seen in the medium and long term. Per capita water consumption in England (E8b) increased (a deterioration) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (3-year moving average time periods ending 2015/2016 to 2020/2021), showed little or no change in the medium term and decreased (an improvement) over the long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvements seen in the medium or long term would be on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. See \u2018Readiness and links to data\u2019 section for this indicator for reference to water companies\u2019 reporting against targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in water leakage since 2018 while per capita water consumption has increased (a deterioration). This is based on 4 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

This represents a valuable output from the land and other resources used. Volume of agricultural production is considered to be a provisioning service provided by a range of natural capital assets (land, water, air, species and ecological communities). This indicator shows annual changes in the index of output volume which provides an overall measure of total production across the wide range of agricultural commodities. The index is calculated using agreed international standards. Farm practices and the use of inputs (particularly fertilisers and pesticides) directly influence the environmental pressures from farming including the quality, composition and availability of habitats and impact on air, water and soils. This indicator should therefore be viewed alongside indicator \u2018E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production\u2019 and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the volume of agricultural production in the UK. Data on [total factor productivity for England by farm type](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-for-england-by-farm-type) are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on [total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-of-the-agricultural-industry) is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description for Figure E2\n\nAfter a period of sustained increase from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s the overall volume of agricultural production (outputs) in the UK has remained relatively stable, with some variation from year to year. Annual variations are generally driven by external factors, in particular weather, affecting growing and harvest and the variation in cropping driven by prices. Over the most recent year (2020), the overall volume of agricultural production in the UK fell by 5.7%; this was driven by a 14.1% decrease in total volume of crop output, a 0.8% decrease in the output volume of livestock for meat, and a 0.5% decrease in the output volume of livestock products.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nAn increase in volume of agricultural production has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and in the medium and long term. It is not possible to categorise this increase as either a simplistic \u2018improvement\u2019 or \u2018deterioration\u2019 as this will depend on numerous factors around farming practices. This indicator is included in the Outcome Indicator Framework to help interpret the reasons behind changes in \u2018E4 Efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity\u2019, rather than to assess progress for a policy driver in the 25 Year Environment Plan.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in volume of agricultural production since 2018, based on 3 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table E2: Assessment of change in the volume of agricultural production in the UK\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2014-2019 | +5.8 (smoothed Loess) | Change (increasing) |\n| Medium term | 2009-2019 | +9.9 (smoothed Loess) | Change (increasing) |\n| Long term | 1973-2019 | +44.6 (smoothed Loess) | Change (increasing) |\n\nNote that assessment categories were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Table E2 may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

The indicator combines data on the intensity and distribution of pressures from human activities with data on the distribution and sensitivity of seabed habitats. Data from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) showing fishing activity are linked to vessel logbook information and processed to create a layer showing abrasion pressure on the seabed. A second layer is produced by combining data on distribution of seabed habitats with information on resilience and resistance to evaluate their sensitivity to the pressure. The pressure and sensitivity layers are combined using a spatial method to create a single data layer showing the area of seabed subject to high disturbance from human activity. This indicator is linked to the \u2019Extent of Physical Damage to Predominant and Special Habitats\u2019 indicator, developed for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and used for the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment of Good Environmental Status (GES).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form as some changes to the method are needed to include additional activities and improve habitat sensitivity assessment. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the predicted area of seabed in the UK Continental Shelf exposed to disturbance from bottom contact fishing by vessels over 12m long. The assessments used for this interim indicator, including data and analytical methods, have been reported under the updated [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/physical-damage/). Inclusion of other human activities, specifically commercial aggregate extraction and improved sensitivity information are in development and will be available as part of the OSPAR Quality Status Report in 2023. Further long-term developments to this indicator will include assessments of new activities associated with localised disturbance pressure and higher resolution fishing data, including small fishing vessels under 12m (as data become available).\n\n## Note on Figures C2i and C2ii\n\nThe degree of disturbance of a habitat is an index based on the predicted spatial and temporal overlap of its sensitivity and exposure to a specific pressure. Sensitivity is assessed using the distribution of habitats and information on species presence collected across the reporting cycle (2010 to 2015). The annual values of the distribution and intensity of pressure are aggregated to give an average pressure intensity for reporting cycle. If the pressure intensity is highly variable across the 6-year period in an area the highest value is taken. Sensitivity and pressure are combined via a matrix, producing 10 categories of disturbance ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 9 (greatest disturbance possible).\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the physical damage to benthic (seafloor) habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nA lack of data relating to the activities of smaller fishing vessels (less than 12m) exists as they are not currently equipped with a VMS recorder. Consequently, there is an underestimate of disturbance in inshore waters. Due to the analytical methods used in the production of fishing pressure layers, there is a potential overestimate of disturbance as a consequence of assuming an even distribution of fishing pressures.\n\n## Trend description for Figures C2i and C2ii\n\nThere is currently no trend assessment due to constraints of current data availability. In future updates, changes over time might be identified by comparing results from multiple reporting cycle assessments such those produced by the UK Marine Strategy every 6 years. Future assessments will enable any trends to be identified, for example the number of regions achieving GES.\n\nThe results from 2010 to 2015 show pressure and disturbance caused by fishing activities to be widespread, occurring to some degree in 57% of the cells within UK waters. The charts show the aggregated values for seafloor disturbance from bottom fishing for the period 2010 to 2015. The highest level of disturbance is found in the English Channel and Southern Celtic Seas with 75% of both these areas being subject to high disturbance (categories 5 to 9). The extent of disturbance in the Northern North Sea and Southern North Sea is lower, 50% and 48% respectively, but still considerably above the target figure for GES. Within each assessment area there are grid cells showing no disturbance or low disturbance (categories 0 to 4), such as some central areas of the Northern North Sea. The Wider Atlantic (OSPAR Region V) was the only region to achieve GES over the assessment period 2010 to 2015 with 12% of its area subjected to high disturbance from bottom contact fishing.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"3.2.1","target_id":"3.2","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-02-01"},"1-2-1":{"computation_units":"MtCO2e","data_footnote":"No data are available for 1991 to 1994 inclusive, 1996 and 1997.","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Sector","value":"Agriculture"},{"field":"Sector","value":"Fluorinated gases"},{"field":"Sector","value":"Net removals by forestry sink"},{"field":"Sector","value":"Net emissions from land use & land use change"},{"field":"Sector","value":"Waste"},{"field":"Sector","value":"Net total including forestry sink"}],"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_category_color":{"Agriculture":"#12436D","Fluorinated gases":"#F46A25","Net emissions from land use & land use change":"#801650","Net removals by forestry sink":"#3F94DE","Net total including forestry sink":"#000000","Waste":"#28A197"},"graph_category_order":{"Agriculture":2,"Fluorinated gases":2,"Net emissions from land use & land use change":2,"Net removals by forestry sink":2,"Net total including forestry sink":1,"Waste":2},"graph_mixed_type":[{"field":"Sector","type":"scatter","value":"Net total including forestry sink"}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":true,"graph_title":"A2: Emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources in England by sector, 1990 to 2019","graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources","indicator_reference":"A2","national_geographical_coverage":"England","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) greenhouse gas emissions inventory data for Agriculture, Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), Waste Management and Industrial Processes</li>\n  <li>The UK Climate Change Act 2008 requires an annual report by the Committee on Climate Change to parliament on whether the UK is on course to meet its carbon budgets and targets</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"England","oif_headline":"Greenhouse gas emissions","oif_indicator_status":"Final","oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Mitigating and adapting to climate change"],"oif_relevant_target":["Continuing to cut net greenhouse gas emissions including from land use, land use change, the agriculture and waste sectors and the use of fluorinated gases","The UK Climate Change Act commits the UK to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100% of 1990 levels (net zero) by 2050"],"oif_theme":"Air","published":true,"reporting_status":"Final","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy","title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator tracks the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural resources as described in the [Clean Growth Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/clean-growth-strategy). GHGs contribute to global climate change which is a pressure on many aspects of our environment. The indicator shows the annual net amount of GHG emissions from land use and land use change, forestry, agriculture, and waste sectors and from the use of fluorinated gases. It measures GHG emissions on a \u2018territorial\u2019 basis, which means that only emissions occurring within England\u2019s borders are included.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nUnderlying data are published annually in the [Greenhouse Gas Inventories 1990 to 2019](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1019). Additional information is also published annually in [UK Spatial Emissions Methodology 2019](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1024) and mapping of the UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory sectors to the sectors used in this indicator is available in the [Net Zero Strategy: emissions taxonomy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy).\n\n## Note on Figure A2\n\nThe data in this indicator are reflective of the current definition for GHGs from natural resources, they may be subject to change in future updates.\n\nThe whole time series is revised annually to take account of any methodological improvements, reflect the latest data, and follow the latest international guidelines. Two revisions in particular have had a marked impact on the 2022 update of this indicator:\n\nFirst, methodologies for wetlands from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2013 supplement to the 2006 IPCC guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands' have been implemented in the 1990 to 2019 Greenhouse Gas Inventory to better represent emissions from drained and rewetted inland organic soils (peatlands). This has increased emissions estimates predominantly in the land use and land use change category. Including the impact of other changes as well, land use and land use change emissions estimates in England have increased overall by around 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) each year from 1990 to 2018 compared with figures published last year.\n\nSecond, a new UK-specific version of \u2018HFC Outlook\u2019, a model previously developed to support the UN Environment Programme and European partnership for Energy and Environment has also been implemented in the 1990 to 2019 Greenhouse Gas Inventory to better represent emissions from Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heat Pumps included within the fluorinated gases category.\n\nFurther details on both these and other revisions can be found in the [2019 UK greenhouse gas emissions: final figures - statistical release.](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fstatistics%2Ffinal-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-1990-to-2019&data=04%7C01%7CSimon.Hatfield%40defra.gov.uk%7Cf35bf54f415547d1340808da1e082497%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C0%7C0%7C637855317571345500%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=Trvq1kann77C7p5cyPXic5wy6ALSUpIolGVKcjrP2sY%3D&reserved=0)\n\n## Trend description for Figure A2\n\nAfter a small initial increase, net emissions of GHGs from natural resources in England have fallen by 50%, from 111 MtCO2e in 1990 to 56 MtCO2e in 2019. Net GHG emissions have fallen from all sectors included within this indicator; however, the greatest reduction has been achieved in the waste sector (38 MtCO2e or 71%). While net emissions from land use and land use change, and emissions from fluorinated gases and agriculture have fallen by 33%, 33% and 16% respectively, and net removals by the forestry sector have increased by 14%, the total net improvements in these 4 sectors combined (17 MtCO2e) is less than half of that achieved in the waste sector. More recently, for example, in the latest 10 years, emissions of GHGs from the waste sector and net emissions from land use and land use change have continued to fall, whereas net removals by the forestry sector and emissions from agriculture have fluctuated but show little overall change between 2009 and 2019. Emissions from fluorinated gases have increased by 10% since 2009.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nA decrease (or improvement) in emissions of GHGs from natural resources has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as in the medium and long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in emissions of GHGs from natural resources since 2018. However, this is based on 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table A2: Assessment of change in emissions of greenhouse gases from natural resources in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -6.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | -20.9 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1990-2018 | -50.0 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\nNote that assessment categories for short, medium and long term were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Table A2 may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

This indicator will show how the number of invasive non-native species entering Great Britain has been abated (reduced) by comparing a predicted trend for establishment of invasive non-native species against actual establishment. Establishment of invasive species depends on factors such as trade and climate change. The difference to the trend in actual establishment then provides a measure of the success of biosecurity measures.\n\nThe indicator will draw on data from the [Non-Native Species Information Portal](https://www.nonnativespecies.org/non-native-species/information-portal/), overseen by the \u2018Great Britain Non-Native Species Secretariat\u2019, which maintains an early detection, surveillance and monitoring mechanism that facilitates management, including rapid response. This indicator requires significant development, including deciding on which species to include and establishing a baseline for the predicted and established trend.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the number of [established non-native species in Great Britain](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b6-invasive-species/). These data are published annually as [UK Biodiversity Indicator B6 \u2013 Pressure from invasive species](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b6-invasive-species/). Further development is required to compare these data against a predicted trend.\n\n## Note on Figure H1\n\nThere are 3,248 non-native species in Great Britain, 2,016 of which are classified as established (reproducing in the wild). This indicator contains 194 non-native species that are considered to be exerting a negative impact on native biodiversity (47 freshwater species, 39 marine species and 108 terrestrial species). The majority (187) of these species are established; 6 are long-term residents but not known to breed in the wild.\n\n## Trend description for Figure H1\n\nBetween the period 1960 to 1969 and the year 2020, the number of invasive non-native species established in or along 10% or more of Great Britain\u2019s land area or coastline has increased in the freshwater, terrestrial and marine (coastal) environments, with the greatest increases in numbers having been observed in the marine and terrestrial environments.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThe H1 indicator \u2018Abatement of the number of invasive non-native species entering and establishing against a baseline\u2019 reports one cumulative data point for each 10-year period included within the indicator, unlike the majority of other indicators that report annually. Therefore, it is only possible to assess long-term trends as there are insufficient data points to establish trends over shorter time periods. An increase (or deterioration) was observed over the long term for freshwater, marine and terrestrial non-native species.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

These also affect the wildlife and ecology of rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.\n\nData will be derived from the existing Riverine Input and Direct Discharges (RID) data collected under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and the Environment Agency\u2019s Emissions Inventory.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows relative changes in measured riverine loads (inputs) of selected metals and nutrients into English tidal waters between 2008 and 2019, covering cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, zinc, nitrogen and ortho-phosphate. Some data for this interim indicator have previously been published as part of the OSPAR assessments ([Inputs of Mercury, Cadmium and Lead via Water and Air to the Greater North Sea](https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/pressures-human-activities/contaminants/heavy-metal-inputs/)) although for different time periods and so these data should be compared with caution.\n\nFurther development is required to present statistical trends for the selected contaminants in an indicator. These data are taken from the existing OSPAR database. The Environment Agency reports a subset of these data to Defra on an annual basis known as the RIDS dataset, \u2018Riverine and Industrial Discharges\u2019.\n\nContact the Environment Agency\u2019s National Customer Contact Centre ([enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk](mailto:enquiries@environment-agency.gov.uk)) for the OSPAR database extract used for the interim indicator.\n\n## Note on Figures B1a and B1b\n\nData collection for this interim indicator was heavily impacted by adherence to the government\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions during the pandemic. In total, only 357 samples were taken and analysed in 2020 compared with 1,237 samples in 2019. In addition, all the samples for 2020 were taken during wetter months with high flow rates (306 in January to March and 51 in October to December); no samples were collected in the period April to September. Therefore, the summary data for 2020 are unlikely to be representative of the true levels of riverine inputs into English tidal waters and are not reported in this indicator.\n\nLoad (input) calculations (kg per day) are the product of the monitored concentration of substance and flow rate. The annual total loads (kg per year) for selected metals (total fraction), total nitrogen and ortho-phosphate are calculated using chemical concentration data reported in the [Water quality data Archive](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/landing) and flow data reported in the Environment Agency\u2019s core system of hydrometric and hydrological values (Water Information System by Kisters).\n\nFigures B1a and B1b show each annual load relative to the 2008 monitored load (2008 is represented as a baseline index = 100). Observed fluctuations in the data could be influenced by a number of external factors affecting movement and loading within river systems. These factors include flow caused by high or low rainfall in a given year and local impacts of changing industry or land use over time. There appears to be a relationship between high flows and high loads, and it should also be noted that the baseline year of 2008 saw high flows.\n\n## Trend description for Figures B1a and B1b\n\n### B1a) Riverine inputs of selected metals\n\nRiverine inputs of cadmium, copper, lead, mercury and zinc into English tidal waters have fluctuated considerably between 2008 and 2019, but overall, they have all fallen. Measured loads of cadmium, mercury, copper, zinc and lead were 49%, 45%, 41% 32% and 21% respectively less in 2019 than they were in 2008.\n\n### B1b) Riverine inputs of selected nutrients\n\nRiverine inputs of total nitrogen and ortho-phosphate have also fluctuated considerably between 2008 and 2019, but overall, both have fallen, and both have remained below their baseline value with measured loads in 2019 being 41% and 49% respectively less than those measured in 2008.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as further development is required to present statistical trends for the selected contaminants in an indicator.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"2.1.1","target_id":"2.1","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-01-01","graph_title":"Pollution loads entering waters"},"7-4-1":{"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"G4a (interim)","units":"Weighted percentage"},{"series":"G4b (interim)","units":"Weighted percentage"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values_by_series":[{"field":"Frequency of visits","series":"G4a (interim)","value":"At least once a week"},{"field":"Frequency of visits","series":"G4a (interim)","value":"Less than once a month"},{"field":"Frequency of visits","series":"G4a (interim)","value":"Never"},{"field":"Frequency of visits","series":"G4a (interim)","value":"Once or twice a month"}],"geographical_area":[{"area":"England","series":"G4a (interim)"},{"area":"England","series":"G4b (interim)"}],"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_category_color":{"G4a (interim)":{"At least once a week":"#12436D","Less than once a month":"#801650","Never":"#28A197","Once or twice a month":"#F46A25"},"G4b (interim)":{"England":"#12436D"}},"graph_category_order":{"G4a (interim)":{"At least once a week":0,"Less than once a month":2,"Never":3,"Once or twice a month":1}},"graph_notes":[{"note":"Based on MENE survey data collected between 2009 and 2019 (inclusive).

In addition, other measures of engagement relating to people\u2019s care and concern for the environment are measured as part of indicators \u2018G5 People engaged in social action for the environment\u2019 and \u2018G6 Environmental attitudes and behaviours\u2019.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. A revised interim indicator is provided here that presents data from 2 of Natural England\u2019s nationally representative surveys on time spent in natural spaces (spanning a wide set of green and blue spaces, both urban and rural):\n\n1. Historic data (2009/2010 to 2018/2019) for adults from the [Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitor-of-engagement-with-the-natural-environment-survey-purpose-and-results) survey.\n2. Baseline data for adults from the [People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england) (PANS). PANS began collecting data on an on-going basis from 2 April 2020 and can now report on engagement after a year of data collection (up to 31 March 2021). Further information on PANS survey methods, outputs and the full questionnaires, are available on the [PANS homepage](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england#monthly-interim-indicators). The PANS team welcomes collaboration and feedback via the [PANS user hub](https://people-and-nature-survey-defra.hub.arcgis.com/).\n\nFurther work is underway to be able to finalise measures used for this indicator taken from MENE and/or PANS, including.\n\n1. On-going collection of data past year 1 of PANS to allow for examination of trends over time.\n2. Work to test and progress the harmonisation of PANS data with the 10 years\u2019 of MENE data which at present are not comparable. More information on methodological differences between the surveys and the work underway to understand, and potentially harmonise datasets is available on Natural England\u2019s [methods and limitations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/survey-methods-and-technical-details/methods-and-limitations) webpage.\n3. Work to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on the trends for this indicator.\n\nSimilar data for children from the [Children\u2019s People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics/the-childrens-people-and-nature-survey-for-england-summer-holidays-2021-official-statistics) (C-PANS) which measures the engagement of children with nature during school holiday-time and term-time will be included in the 2023 Outcome Indicator Framework report.\n\n## Trend description for Figures G4a and G4b\n\n### G4a) Visits to the natural environment\n\nThe MENE survey showed an increase in the proportion of adults visiting the natural environment at least once a week, from 54% in 2009/2010 to 65% in 2018/2019.\n\n### G4b) Visits to green and natural spaces\n\nThe PANS survey cannot yet show yearly trends or be compared to the earlier MENE data. However, data from 2020/2021 show that 71% of adults said they had visited green and natural spaces at least once a week (11% once or twice a month, 14% less than once a month, and 4% never did this).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThis year\u2019s Outcome Indicator Framework report presents a baseline year of data on frequency of visits to the natural environment from PANS. When a sufficient time series is available, we will use this new indicator for the assessment of change. In the meantime, trends in the historic data from the MENE survey have been assessed. The time series for the MENE indicator on frequency of visits to the natural environment is not long enough to produce an assessment for medium and long-term time periods. An increase (or improvement) was observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018).\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. An increase (or improvement) in frequency of visits to the natural environment was observed since 2018 (up to 2019). However, this is based on 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table G4a: Assessment of change in the frequency of visits to the natural environment in the past 12 months by adults in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +13.9 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\nNote that assessment categories for the short term were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Table G4a may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

The indicator will have 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those widespread species for which relevant data are available; and (b) changes in the distribution (the number of 1km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of widespread species for which relevant data are available.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the abundance of (a) breeding wild birds, (b) widespread butterflies and (c) widespread bats in England. The expectation is that this indicator will be expanded to include more species groups and habitat types in the future. Some data are already published annually elsewhere ([wild birds](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/wild-bird-populations-in-england), [butterflies on farmland and in woodland, and bats](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators)), and methods for analysing trends in plants are being developed. Further work is required to combine and present trends for different species groups and habitat types within the abundance and distribution measures in this indicator.\n\n## Note on Figures D4ai, D4aii, D4bi, D4bii and D4c\n\nDue to COVID-19 restrictions in England, the latest Breeding Bird Survey report prepared by the British Trust for Ornithology, the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee collected limited data in 2020 and therefore it was not possible to update the indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England either here or in the source publication.\n\n## Trend description for Figures D4ai, D4aii, D4bi, D4bii and D4c\n\nWhilst the following overall trends are clear from the charts, they mask the trends for individual species within each index \u2013 some farmland and woodland species trends have increased whereas others have either remained the same or decreased over time. Further details on these individual species trends are available in the source publications.\n\n### D4a) Breeding wild birds\n\nThe indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England have both declined between 1970 and 2019; the former by almost 30%, the latter by 60%. Farmland birds experienced steeper declines during the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s because of rapid changes in farmland management.\n\n### D4b) Widespread butterflies\n\nThe indicators for widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland in England also declined between 1990 and 2010, the former more steeply than the latter. However, in recent years, the woodland butterfly indicator has shown little change while the farmland butterfly indicator has increased to a figure similar to its 1990 baseline value.\n\n### D4c) Widespread bats\n\nThe indicator for widespread bats in England has increased by approximately 40% since the turn of the century. The bat species within this index vary in their habitat requirements, but all occur in farmland and woodland landscapes.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nIndicators for breeding wild birds, widespread butterflies and widespread bats in England are also reported in the [England Biodiversity Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators), which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is tailored to the datasets of the specific taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies and bats) and factors-in information on confidence. The assessment found a decrease (or deterioration) in both breeding wild birds on farmland and woodland in England over the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There was little or no change in widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland over this period, and an increase (or improvement) in widespread bats. Over the long term, decreases in breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland, and widespread butterflies in woodland, were recorded. Widespread butterflies on farmland showed little or no change in the long term, while widespread bats increased.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. An assessment using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology was only available for butterflies for this time period. Little or no change was seen since 2018 for both widespread woodland and farmland butterflies. However, this is based on 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in sections 5 and 6 of the latest [England Biodiversity Indicators report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Further information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

Chemical reactions in the air involving nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produce the toxic gas O3 which can harm health, damage wild plants, crops, forests, and some materials, and is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as a pressure on human health and thriving plants and wildlife. It is determined by calculating the annual average of the maximum daily 8-hour mean concentrations of O3 measured at all rural measurement sites on Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on concentrations of ozone are published annually as [National Statistics, Air Quality Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/air-quality-statistics).\n\n## Trend description for Figure A4\n\nThe average daily maximum 8 hour mean concentration of O3 has fluctuated since the beginning of the time series in 1987. It was 72.3\u03bcg per m3 in 2020; a 29% increase in concentration compared to 1987 but similar to the concentration observed in 2019 (71.8\u03bcg per m3). Some variance from year to year is expected due to fluctuations in the occurrence of hot summer weather conditions which are associated with high O3 concentrations.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nRural background concentrations of O3 increased (a deterioration) over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and over the medium and long-term time periods.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed.

The assessments of marine mammals will be based on trends in the abundance of harbour seals; Atlantic grey seal pup production; and the abundance of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). The assessments of marine birds will be based on the proportion of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds that have met abundance targets, which were set to inform progress towards Good Environmental Status (GES). The GES assessments of marine mammals and birds were used in the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form as some further development is being undertaken. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (a) changes in the abundance of harbour seals and the production of Atlantic grey seal pups in the north-east and south-east of England, and (b) changes in the abundance of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas ([OSPAR marine regions](https://www.ospar.org/convention/the-north-east-atlantic) including data from neighbouring countries). The assessments of [seals](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/seals/) and marine [birds](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/birds/) used for this interim indicator have been reported at a UK scale under the updated [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marine-strategy-part-one-uk-updated-assessment-and-good-environmental-status). The assessment for seals used data from 1994 to 2014, whereas the most recent data on seals presented in Figures C3ai and C3aii are published by the [Special Committee on Seals (SCOS)](http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/research-policy/scos/). The indicator will be kept under review during the development of \u2018D5 Conservation status of our native species\u2019 as some elements of this indicator may ultimately be included in D5 instead. Cetaceans are not yet included in this indicator, but they will be once more definitive assessments can be made. Whale and dolphin species were assessed in the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) using [data on abundance](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/cetaceans/). However, for most species, trends in abundance could not be determined because there were an insufficient number of population estimates.\n\n## Note on Figures C3ai, C3aii, C3bi and C3bii\n\nWhile the data currently available for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in this interim indicator predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of changes in GES of marine birds. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTargets for GES were met if harbour seal abundance and Atlantic grey seal pup production: a) declined by less than an average of 1% per year during 2009 to 2014, or b) decreased by less than 25% since the baseline year (1992 or start of time series, if later). The UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) GES assessment for seals covered the Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea. No data are available for harbour seal abundance in north-east England for the years 2020 and 2021 as COVID-19 related travel and working restrictions prevented aerial surveys of most harbour seal sites in these years.\n\nGES is achieved for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds if 75% or more species meet or exceed their thresholds for relative abundance (the dashed horizontal line on Figures C3bi and C3bii). The relative abundance of a species is the annual abundance expressed as a proportion of the baseline, which was taken as the abundance at the start of the timeseries in 1992. Thresholds for relative abundance were set to define GES: greater than 80% of the baseline for species that lay one egg and greater than 70% of the baseline for species that lay more than one egg.\n\n## Trend description for Figures C3ai, C3aii, C3bi and C3bii\n\n### C3a) Seals\n\nTrends in harbour seal numbers in eastern England had been largely positive since the mid-1990s, although they appear to have levelled off and then fallen between 2015 and 2021. In the south-east, where the majority of the England population are found, numbers have fluctuated showing an increase from 2,793 in 1995 to 4,944 in 2018 followed by a sharp decline to 3,752 in 2019, corresponding to a reduction of 25%. Since 2019, numbers have continued to decline at a slower rate reaching a value of 3,505 in the latest survey conducted in 2021. Numbers are much lower in north-east England; they have shown a steady increase from 45 animals in 1994 to 91 in 2015 before declining to 79 in 2019. The UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1994 to 2014 concluded that because of declines in Scotland, GES had not been achieved for harbour seal abundance in the UK Greater North Sea sub-region (which includes seal populations in the north-east and south-east of England).\n\nIn south-east England annual Atlantic grey seal pup production has risen exponentially from just 200 pups in 1992 to 7,902 pups in 2019. In north-east England the rise in pup production has been steadier, from 985 pups in 1992 to 2,823 in 2019. The UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1992 to 2014 concluded that GES for Atlantic grey seals has been achieved in the Greater North Sea.\n\n### C3b) Marine birds\n\nThe proportion of seabird species meeting thresholds for breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas has remained stable since 2012 but remains below the 75% target (59% in the Greater North Sea in 2014 and 63% in the Celtic Seas in 2015). The UK Marine Strategy (2019) assessment concluded GES for breeding seabirds has not been achieved in the Greater North Sea or Celtic Seas.\n\nThe proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds for non-breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea has declined sharply but was still on target in 2013 to 2014 (78%); the proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds in the Celtic Seas has also declined sharply (53% in 2014 to 2015) and has remained below target since 2006. GES for non-breeding (wintering) waterbirds has been achieved in the Greater North Sea but not in the Celtic Seas.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nAn increase (or improvement) in the abundance of harbour seals in both the north-east and south-east of England was observed in the medium and long term. Increases were also found in the north-east over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018). A decrease (deterioration) in harbour seal abundance was found in the south-east over most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed but note the different data range this applies to (2015 to 2020) and that harbour seals are present in much higher numbers in the south-east. An increase (or improvement) in grey seal pup production was found in both regions over most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2013 to 2018), as well as over the medium and long term. These overall trends were assessed using smoothed data do not pick up on small scale patterns in abundance.\n\nIn the Greater North Sea, little or no change was observed in the percentage of breeding seabirds or wintering waterbirds meeting abundance targets for GES over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2008 to 2013). In the Celtic Seas, there was also little or no change for breeding seabirds over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2009 to 2014), but the percentage of wintering waterbirds meeting abundance targets decreased (a deterioration). There has been a decrease in all 4 indicators for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds over the medium and long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Since 2018, there was little or no change in harbour seal abundance in the north-east, and a decrease in the south-east. An increase in grey seal pup production was found in both regions. However, this is based on less than 5 data points (2 for the north-east and 4 for the south-east) so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend. No data are available after 2018 for assessing bird indicators.\n\nThis assessment does not consider whether any improvements are on a sufficient scale for meeting targets. The assessment results reported here are not directly comparable with other analyses published elsewhere that use different methodologies to explore these indicators or are based on alternative datasets.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table C3aia: Assessment of change in harbour seal abundance, North-east England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +10.0 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | +50.0 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1994-2018 | +83.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table C3aib: Assessment of change in harbour seal abundance, South-east England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2015-2020 | -14.8 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | 2010-2020 | +3.7 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1995-2020 | +38.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table C3aiia: Assessment of change in Atlantic grey seal pup production, North-east England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +50.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | +97.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1990-2018 | +169.9 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table C3aiib: Assessment of change in Atlantic grey seal pup production, South-east England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +77.3 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | +274.4 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1990-2018 | +3287.9 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table C3bia: Assessment of change in the percentage of breeding seabirds meeting abundance targets for Good Environmental Status (GES), Greater North Sea\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2008-2013 | -0.6 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2003-2013 | -8.6 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Long term | 1992-2013 | -28.2 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table C3bib: Assessment of change in the percentage of breeding seabirds meeting abundance targets for Good Environmental Status (GES), Celtic Seas\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2009-2014 | +1.3 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2004-2014 | -23.1 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Long term | 1992-2014 | -27.9 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table C3biia: Assessment of change in the percentage of wintering waterbirds meeting abundance targets for Good Environmental Status (GES), Greater North Sea\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2007/2008-2012/2013 | -2.6 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2002/2003-2012/2013 | -8.7 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Long term | 1992/1993-2012/2013 | -10.2 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table C3biib: Assessment of change in the percentage of wintering waterbirds meeting abundance targets for Good Environmental Status (GES), Celtic Seas\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2008/2009-2013/2014 | -15.5 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | 2003/2004-2013/2014 | -30.9 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Long term | 1992/1993-2013/2014 | -35.4 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n\nNote that assessment categories for the short, medium and long term were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables C3ai to C3biib may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

Preventing the spread of invasive non-native species limits their ability to disrupt ecosystems and cause economic damage. Plant pests and diseases cause significant negative impacts and it is often more difficult to prevent their entry and establishment, therefore limiting spread is critical in preventing negative impact on native species and ecosystems. This indicator will utilise distribution data for a reference subset of priority invasive species and plant pests and diseases as an indication of the success of biosecurity measures in controlling their spread.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England since the year 2000. These data are published in the [Forestry Commission\u2019s Key Performance Indicators Reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators). Further development is required to identify species for inclusion and develop the indicator drawing on existing data.\n\n## Note on Figure H2\n\nThis indicator enumerates those additional tree pests and diseases formally considered as becoming \u2018established\u2019 by the UK Plant Health Risk Group within a rolling 10-year period. Establishment is defined as \u2018perpetuation, for the foreseeable future, of a pest within an area after entry\u2019. This is the definition produced by the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention.\n\nIt is not possible to sum the number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established within each 10-year period to calculate the total number becoming established since 2000. This is because each tree pest or disease is included in up to 10 rolling 10-year time periods; adding them together would result in a greatly inflated total for the time period covered by this indicator.\n\n## Trend description for Figure H2\n\nThe number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England within a rolling 10-year period fell from a peak of 7 in 2000-2009 to a low of 3 in 2007-2016. It subsequently increased again to 5 in 2009-2018 before falling to 4 in 2010-2019 and 2011-2020 (the 2 most recent 10-year periods for which data are available). In total, 11 tree pests and diseases became established in England in the 20 years from 2000 to 2020 and of these, the 4 \u2018established\u2019 between 2011 and 2020 are:\n\n1. Chalara dieback of Ash (*Hymenoscyphus fraxineus*), considered established in 2012.\n2. Oriental chestnut gall wasp (*Dryocosmus kuriphilus*), considered established in 2016.\n3. Sweet chestnut blight caused by the fungus *Cryphonectria parasitica*, considered established in 2017.\n4. The Elm zigzag sawfly *(Aproceros leucopoda*), considered established in 2018, following a rapid expansion across Europe from eastern Asia\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the interim indicator for H2 Number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established in England over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (10-year rolling time periods ending 2015 and 2020). However, there has been a decrease (improvement) over the medium and long term.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been a decrease in number of additional tree pests and diseases becoming established since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

In addition, labour and land is required as well as depreciation of capital. Minimising the use of these inputs is an important policy driver to improve productivity and hence improve profitability whilst reducing the environmental impacts of farming. Farm practices and the use of inputs (particularly fertilisers and pesticides) directly influence the environmental pressures from farming including the quality, composition and availability of habitats and impact on air, water and soils. Volume of inputs may therefore be considered an indirect measure of pressure on a range of natural capital assets.\n\nThis indicator should be viewed alongside indicator \u2018E2 Volume of agricultural production\u2019 and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets. The index of the volume of inputs is an overall measure of the total inputs used with price effects removed. This includes all inputs including intermediate consumption, land, labour and depreciation of capital.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK.\n\nData on [total factor productivity for England by farm type](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-for-england-by-farm-type) are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on [total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-of-the-agricultural-industry) is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description for Figure E3\n\nThe volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK has shown an overall decline since 1973. Most of this decline took place between the late 1990s and 2006; since then, there has been a slight increase in the volume of inputs used in agricultural production, but the volume remains below historical levels. Over the most recent year (2020), the volume of inputs used in agricultural production in the UK fell slightly (by 1.2%).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nAn increase in volume of inputs used in agricultural production has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019), and in the medium term. This is in contrast to long-term decreasing trends. It is not possible to simplistically categorise these changes as either an \u2018improvement\u2019 or \u2018deterioration\u2019 for the environment as this will depend on the types of input driving change. An increase in inputs of pesticide and fertiliser would likely have a negative effect, but this indicator also includes other inputs such as labour. This indicator is included in the Outcome Indicator Framework to help interpret the reasons behind changes in \u2018E4 Efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity\u2019.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in volume of inputs used in agricultural production since 2018, based on 3 years of data.

The indicator is derived from assessments of individual stocks. Where available, the assessment of stocks against their Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) will be incorporated into the overall indicator. The indicator is linked to UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 3 (Commercial Fish and Shellfish) and the Convention on Biological Diversity sustainable fisheries indicators and is derived from International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and national stock assessments.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. A revised interim indicator is presented here that shows: the percentage of stocks of UK interest fished at or below the level capable of producing MSY (FMSY); and the percentage of stocks with spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the level capable of producing MSY (MSY Btrigger). The revised indicator also introduces a new upper limit (Fupper, where available) for a number of stocks that are fished above FMSY, but within an acceptable mortality range (in FMSY range) as defined by internationally agreed Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs) for fisheries. In addition, a lower limit reference point (Blim) is included for SSB to distinguish a number of stocks that are at a higher risk of reproductive impairment, from those that are at lower risk (that is, above Blim but below MSY Btrigger).\n\nThe assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marine-strategy-part-one-uk-updated-assessment-and-good-environmental-status) using data from 1990 to 2015 for FMSY and from1990 to 2016 for MSY Btrigger. Data on [commercially exploited fish and shellfish](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/pressures-from-human-activities/commercial-fish-and-shellfish/), analytical methods and assessment are available. Data are also published annually in the [UK Biodiversity Indicator B2 \u2013 Sustainable fisheries](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b2-sustainable-fisheries/). National shellfish stocks assessments are updated on a 3-year cycle. These data are not included in the interim indicator but were published as part of the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) and will be included in the final indicator. Once population age and size distribution assessments are developed, they will be included to provide further detail for this indicator.\n\n## Trend description for Figures C10a and C10b\n\nOverall, there is evidence of a positive trend towards a greater proportion of stocks fished sustainably in both the long term and in recent years. There is also a positive trend for fish stocks remaining within safe biological limits in the long term, but a negative trend in recent years. For both measures, there is a decreasing percentage of stocks with unknown status, from almost 50% in 1990 to 23% in 2019.\n\n### C10a) Marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest harvested sustainably\n\nThe percentage of fish stocks (including Norway lobster, *Nephrops norvegicus*) fished at or below FMSY, and/or within acceptable mortality range levels, has increased from 9% in 1990 to 51% in 2019. The percentage fished above FMSY has decreased over the same time period, from 42% of UK quota-fish stocks assessed being fished at levels of fishing pressure above FMSY in 1990 to 26% in 2019.\n\n### C10b) Marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity\n\nTo maintain the reproductive capacity of stocks, each stock\u2019s spawning biomass (SSB) should be at or above the level capable of producing maximum sustainable yield (that is, MSY Btrigger). The percentage of stocks subject to quota management and achieving this goal has increased from 30% in 1990 to 58% in 2019. A further 4% of stocks were at low risk of reproductive impairment (that is, with a SSB below MSY Btrigger but above Blim) in 2019 and 16% more were at high risk of reproductive impairment (that is, with SSB below MSY Btrigger and Blim).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nTwo indicator components are assessed here: \u2018marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest harvested sustainably\u2019 and \u2018marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity\u2019. Assessments of change are made for the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2012 to 2017), as well as medium and long-term periods. In every case there has been an improvement recorded.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Marine fish harvested sustainably decreased (a deterioration) in 2019 while there was little or no change in marine fish stocks with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity. However, this is based on two data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nThe assessment results reported here are not directly comparable with other analyses published elsewhere that use different methodologies to explore these indicator components.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table C10a: Assessment of change in marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest harvested sustainably, (below FMSY or in FMSY range, if available)\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +39.3 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | +113.7 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1990-2018 | +327.0 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n\n### Table C10b: Assessment of change in marine fish (quota) stocks of UK interest with biomass at levels capable of maintaining full reproductive capacity (above MSY Btrigger)\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | +5.6 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2008-2018 | +24.4 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 1990-2018 | +89.1 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n\nNote that assessment categories for the short, medium and long term were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables C10a and C10b may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. The main sources of PM2.5 pollution are industrial processes, combustion in residential, public, commercial, and agricultural sectors and road transport.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the annual population-weighted mean concentration of PM2.5 in the air, assessed as background concentrations per 1km square. The population-weighted mean concentration is used as a measure of the impact of PM2.5 on the health of the total population. Greater weighting is given to concentrations of PM2.5 in urban areas to reflect the higher population density as those concentrations will affect a greater number of people. In addition, people living in urban areas are generally exposed to greater levels of PM2.5 than those living in rural areas.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are published annually at [UK Air Information Resource, Modelled background pollution data](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data).\n\n## Note on Figure A3\n\nPM2.5 annual mean concentrations are estimated annually for every square kilometre of the UK through the Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) model. The geographical distribution of the UK population is then joined to the estimated concentrations to estimate the annual mean concentration of PM2.5, weighted on where the population lives. This enables us to account for most of the population living in densely populated urban areas, where concentrations are likely to be greatest.\n\n## Trend description for Figure A3\n\nPopulation-weighted annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in England have declined from 12.1\u03bcg per m3 in 2011 to 7.5\u03bcg per m3 in 2020, a fall of 38% over the latest 9 years for which data are available.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nConcentrations of PM2.5 decreased (an improvement) over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019). The time series is not yet long enough to make a trend assessment for the medium and long-term time periods. This assessment does not consider whether improvement is on a sufficient scale for meeting any targets.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed where possible. A decrease in concentrations of fine particulate matter was also observed since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

Plants, fungi, algae, invertebrates and soil micro-organisms are particularly important. The presence, abundance and diversity of species are key factors in determining the resilience of ecosystems to environmental changes, including climate change and disease, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. Further research is required to develop this indicator, building on the existing UK pollinator indicator and defining species groups and functions for inclusion.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form, and there were no new data available to update this interim form of the indicator this year. This interim indicator shows trends in the distribution (occupancy of 1km grid squares) of pollinators (bees and hoverflies) in the UK. These data are published annually as [UK Biodiversity Indicator D1c \u2013 Status of pollinating insects](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-d1c-pollinating-insects/). Significant further research and development is required to include a range of species groups important for supporting ecosystem functions in England.\n\n## Trend description for Figures D7i and D7ii\n\nThere was an overall decrease in the UK pollinators index from 1987 onwards. In 2017, the index had declined by 30% compared to its value in 1980. More recently however, this downward trend has slowed, with the indicator decreasing by less than 2% between 2012 and 2017. These overall declines mask the trends of the individual species within the index, 49% of which have become less widespread, 19% of which have become more widespread and 32% of which have shown little or no change since the index began in 1980. By contrast, over the short term (between 2012 and 2017), a slightly greater proportion of species have become more widespread (46%) than have become less widespread (43%).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThe indicator \u2018Change in the distribution of pollinators in the UK\u2019 is also reported in the [England Biodiversity Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators), which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is more tailored to the specific dataset and factors-in information on confidence. No results were available for the medium-term period using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology, although this will be considered for the next publication. The assessment found little or no change in the distribution of pollinators in the UK in the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There was a long-term decrease (or deterioration).\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in section 10 of the latest [England Biodiversity Indicators report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Further information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

As well as being vital for food production, agriculture helps to shape the landscape, providing important recreational, spiritual and other cultural benefits. This indicator shows annual changes in land used for agriculture in 3 categories: grassland (including sole rough grazing); crops (including horticulture and perennial crops); and uncropped arable (land left fallow or under environmental management). Agricultural production and the associated land use and management are key drivers of the environmental impacts from the sector. A key policy challenge is to de-couple production from environmental impact. The indicator may be considered a measure of pressure on the environment, a measure of condition of the land asset, or a measure of service/benefit we derive from the land. The indicator is included in the framework to provide contextual information.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on the [structure of the agricultural industry](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/structure-of-the-agricultural-industry) in England are already published annually as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description for Figure E1\n\nAfter a period of decline in the late 1980s, land use by agriculture has remained relatively stable. Similarly, the split between crops and grazing has remained relatively constant over this time, with grassland accounting for around half of agricultural land (51% in 2021) and crops a little under half (46% in 2021).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for area of agricultural land over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020) and in the medium term. There has been a decrease in the long term since 1984. It is not possible to categorise this decrease as either an \u2018improvement\u2019 or \u2018deterioration\u2019. Whether a change away from agricultural land is positive for the environment will depend on numerous factors such as the farming practices that were employed and what the new land use is.\n\nChange since the start of the 25 Year Environment Plan has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in area of agricultural land since 2018, based on 4 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table E1: Assessment of change in the area of productive agricultural land in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2015-2020 | -0.3 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2010-2020 | -1 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Long term | 1984-2020 | -7.4 (smoothed Loess) | Change (decreasing) |\n\nNote that assessment categories were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Table E1 may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere.

The indicator is based on multi regional input-output (MRIO) modelling, which is used to model global trade flows representing the monetary inputs and outputs across different countries and their commercial sectors. While the indicator is also based on a similar concept and approach to \u2018J1 Carbon footprint and consumer buying choices\u2019 and \u2018J2 Raw material consumption,\u2019 the detail of the methodologies does not align and therefore the results are not directly comparable.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (i) the global deforestation risk and (ii) the global \u2018scarcity-weighted blue water use\u2019 from UK consumption of imported commodities; a further metric to measure biodiversity loss is currently being developed. The figures are calculated using the Input-Output Trade Analysis (IOTA) framework and the results are reported for the first time in 2022 as an experimental statistic; information on how the data have been obtained and how the statistics have been calculated is available in [UK Biodiversity Indicator A4 \u2013 Global biodiversity impacts of UK economic activity and sustainable consumption](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-a4-global-biodiversity-impact/). The data are being published as experimental statistics, both here and within the source publication, to gather feedback and facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator. An early metric for measuring biodiversity loss is included within UK Biodiversity Indicator A4 publication but is undergoing refinement before publication as part of the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n\n## Note on Figures K1i and K1ii\n\nData that trace all commodities back to their exact countries of origin are not publicly available. This information is necessary in order to accurately link production to deforestation and water use. Therefore, the outputs produced by this indicator are derived from modelling these trade flows, and so (whilst based on empirical statistics) they should be considered as best estimates rather than exact figures. Additional caveats and limitations are outlined in the source publication \u2013 the [Global biodiversity impacts of UK economic activity and sustainable consumption](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-a4-global-biodiversity-impact/).\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description for Figures K1i and K1ii\n\n### K1i) Tropical deforestation\n\nUK consumption of crop, cattle-related and timber commodities in 2017 was responsible for an estimated 31,126 hectares of agriculture-driven tropical deforestation worldwide, a long-term decrease of 58% since the time series began in 2005. Comparing the 2017 footprint with 2012 reveals a short-term decrease of 41% and a decrease (6%) was also observed in the latest year (2017).\n\n### K1ii) Blue water use\n\nUK consumption of crop commodities in 2017 was responsible for an estimated 367 billion cubic-meters of scarcity-weighted blue water use worldwide, a decrease of 48% since 2005. Comparing the 2017 footprint with 2012 reveals a 27% decrease, but there was very little change (1% increase) observed in the latest year (2017).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThis indicator was not assessed as it is newly introduced this year and data were not available in time to allow for analysis to be carried out. Assessment is intended to be made in future Outcome Indicator Framework updates.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"10.1.1","target_id":"10.1","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01","graph_title":"Overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities"},"9-2-1":{"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"J2a","units":"Tonnes / capita"},{"series":"J2b","units":"\u00a3 / kg"}],"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"data_start_values_by_series":[{"field":"Category","series":"J2a","value":"Non-metallic mineral materials"},{"field":"Category","series":"J2a","value":"Metal ores"},{"field":"Category","series":"J2a","value":"Biomass"}],"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_category_color":{"J2a":{"Biomass":"#801650","Metal ores":"#F46A25","Non-metallic mineral materials":"#12436D"},"J2b":{"England":"#12436D"}},"graph_category_order":{"J2a":{"Biomass":2,"Metal ores":1,"Non-metallic mineral materials":0}},"graph_notes":[{"note":"These data have been revised since the previous publication due to refinements to the methodology as the source publication underpinning this indicator progressed from experimental to official statistics.","series":"J2a"},{"note":"These data have been revised since the previous publication due to refinements to the methodology as the source publication underpinning this indicator progressed from experimental to official statistics.","series":"J2b"}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":[{"series":"J2a"}],"graph_titles":[{"series":"J2a","title":"J2a: Raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) per capita in England, 2001 to 2018"},{"series":"J2b","title":"J2b: Gross value added per kg of raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) in England, 2001 to 2018"}],"graph_types":[{"series":"J2a","type":"bar"},{"series":"J2b","type":"line"}],"indicator_name":"Raw material consumption","indicator_reference":"J2","national_geographical_coverage":"England","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Links to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 8 and 12</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"England","oif_headline":"Resource efficiency and waste","oif_indicator_status":"Final","oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently","Mitigating and adapting to climate change"],"oif_relevant_target":["Maximising the value and benefits we get from our resources, doubling resource productivity by 2050"],"oif_theme":"Resource Use and Waste","published":false,"reporting_status":"Final","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Defra; Office for National Statistics","title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator shows trends in the amount of (a) raw material consumption (RMC) per capita and (b) the amount of gross value added (GVA) per unit of raw material consumption.

It peaked in 2004, decreased steadily until 2007 and then fell sharply during the 2008 to 2009 recession.

Within the overall total, per capita consumption of non-metallic mineral materials, metal ores and biomass have all decreased between 2001 and 2018 (by 27%, 40% and 17% respectively).\n\n### J2b) Gross value added per kg of raw material consumption\n\nIn 2018, England generated approximately 62.0% more economic value than in 2001 (measured by GVA per unit of RMC (excluding fossil fuels), also described as resource productivity). Resource productivity measured on this basis, rose from \u00a31.53 of GVA per kg of RMC in 2001 to a peak of \u00a32.48 in 2012 before declining until 2015, and then regaining its 2012 peak in 2018.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThere has been an improvement recorded over the medium and long term for both interim indicators for J2: J2a Raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) per capita in England and J2b Gross value added per kg of raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) in England. However, in the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2012 to 2017), RMC has begun to increase again (meaning a deterioration for the indicator) and progress has stalled for GVA per kg of RMC with an assessment of \u2018little or no change\u2019.\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page.

Secondly, monitoring at an England scale of the public\u2019s perceptions of landscape character and how those perceptions relate to the landscape change trends being identified. Thirdly, findings will be informed by on-going monitoring (since 2013) of environmental outcomes in our protected landscapes (National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty). The composite indicator will build on an approach that has been developed to assess the impacts of agri-environment schemes on landscape in 159 NCAs and will be structured by landscape change themes such as field patterns and boundaries, waterscapes historic features, semi-natural habitats, agricultural land use, settlement patterns and development, and woodland or tree cover. The NCA profiles (currently being refreshed and placed on a digital platform) include Statements of Environmental Opportunity, which are being utilised to evaluate changes detected in landscape and waterscape character.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022. Substantial further development work is required to build on existing methods and information sources to assess changes in landscape and waterscape character.\n\nProgress has been made towards an indicator that will be made available in 2023, including establishment of a set of indicators and metrics for the suite of landscape change themes associated with the NCA change database. A change atlas and dashboard are currently under development to allow interactive access to detailed findings for a range of audiences. A baseline analysis and evaluation of the NCA and protected landscape change data is also under way from which headline findings will inform the composite indicator. In addition, progress has been made in assessing how the [People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england) (PANS) results can be used to develop a metric for public perception of landscape character. Opportunities have been identified to enhance and capture additional information in future PANS surveys relating more specifically to people\u2019s perceptions and preferences about landscape that can inform landscape change monitoring.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as it is still in development.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"7.1.1","target_id":"7.1","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-01-01","graph_title":"Changes in landscape and waterscape character"},"3-4-1":{"data_footnote":null,"graph_notes":null,"data_non_statistical":false,"embedded_feature_footer":"components/embedded-features/C4a-footer.html","embedded_feature_html":"components/embedded-features/C4a.html","embedded_feature_layout":"quartet","embedded_feature_tab_title":"Map, C4 (interim)","embedded_feature_title":"C4 (interim): Regional sea assessments, and the status of coastal water bodies and offshore units for 4 UK seafloor habitats, 2010 to 2015","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","hide_chart":true,"hide_table":true,"indicator_name":"Diverse seas: condition of seafloor habitats","indicator_reference":"C4","national_geographical_coverage":"UK","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 14</li>\n  <li>Water Framework Regulations \u2013 The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017, The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017, Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"UK","oif_headline":"Diversity of our seas","oif_indicator_status":"Interim","oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - seas"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Reversing the loss of marine biodiversity and, where practicable, restoring it","Ensuring seafloor habitats are productive and sufficiently extensive to support healthy, sustainable ecosystems"],"oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","published":false,"reporting_status":"Interim","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Defra; Environment Agency; Joint Nature Conservation Committee; Natural Resources Wales; Scottish Environment Protection Agency","title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator of diverse seas evaluates the condition of seafloor habitats. Seafloor habitats assessed include soft sediment invertebrate communities and intertidal communities of seagrass, rocky shore macroalgae and saltmarshes. Once developed the indicator will assess the impact of human activities on seafloor habitats.\n\nData for the seafloor habitat condition indicators come from surveys undertaken on a 6-yearly cycle using methods developed for Water Framework Directive (WFD) classifications, now transposed to the Water Framework Directive Regulations. These include the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae tool, intertidal seagrass tool, Infaunal Quality Index, and intertidal saltmarsh tool.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows target achievement for regional sea assessment, status of coastal water bodies and offshore unit assessments. The assessments used for this indicator have been reported under the updated [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marine-strategy-part-one-uk-updated-assessment-and-good-environmental-status) to assess progress towards the UK Marine Strategy target of achieving and maintaining Good Environmental Status (GES) in UK seas.\n\nData on [benthic (sea floor) habitats,](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/) analytical methods and assessment are available, including information on the [intertidal rocky shore macroalgae tool](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/intertidal-rocky-shore/), [intertidal seagrass tool](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/intertidal-seagrass/), [Infaunal Quality Index](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/infaunal-quality-index/), and [intertidal saltmarsh tool](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/intertidal-saltmarsh/).\n\nThe indicator will be further developed to include data on the condition of benthic communities. When data are available, C4 may also be based upon data on the condition of sublittoral rock communities (those that occur from the lowest point exposed by low tide to the edge of the continental shelf) and the condition of biogenic reefs (formed by horse mussel and Ross worm). A trial assessment on the condition of benthic communities was reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) to assess progress towards the UK Marine Strategy target of achieving and maintaining Good Environmental Status (GES) in UK seas.\n\n## Note on Figure C4\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the condition of benthic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description for Figure C4\n\n### C4i) Seagrass\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for intertidal seagrass communities was met for all Regional Seas. Four Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data. The natural conditions required for seagrass beds to exist limits their occurrence in coastal water bodies. However, for those contributing, the quality threshold of \u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018High\u2019 Ecological Status was met for the majority of surveyed locations. The Irish Sea had the lowest extent of intertidal seagrass meeting the quality target, although the total remains markedly above the indicator quantity threshold of 85%.\n\n### C4ii) Rocky shore macroalgae\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae was met for all 7 assessed Regional Seas. Two Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data.\n\n### C4iii) Saltmarsh\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for the saltmarsh communities was largely met for the Celtic Seas and Northern North Sea but was not met for considerable areas of the Southern North Sea and the Eastern English Channel Regional Seas. Five Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data.\n\n### C4iv) Soft sediment invertebrates\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for soft sediment (benthic) invertebrate communities was largely met for most Regional Seas including the Minches and western Scotland, Scottish Continental Shelf, Shared Waters between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland, Northern North Sea and Eastern English Channel. The Western English Channel and Celtic Seas did not reach the target largely due to the inshore classification results, while the failure of the Southern North Sea to meet the target can be attributed to the offshore results. The Irish Sea did not meet the target due to both inshore and offshore results. The Atlantic North-West Approaches was not assessed due to an absence of data.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"3.4.1","target_id":"3.4","sdg_goal":"3","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-04-01","graph_title":"Diverse seas: condition of seafloor habitats"},"3-7-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"embedded_feature_2_footer":"components/embedded-features/C7b-footer.html","embedded_feature_2_html":"components/embedded-features/C7b.html","embedded_feature_2_layout":"double","embedded_feature_2_tab_title":"Map (C7b)","embedded_feature_2_title":"C7b (interim): Long-term changes in the mean maximum length of demersal and pelagic fish communities in UK waters and surrounding areas, 1980 or 1990 to 2015 or 2016","embedded_feature_footer":"components/embedded-features/C7a-footer.html","embedded_feature_html":"components/embedded-features/C7a.html","embedded_feature_layout":"double","embedded_feature_tab_title":"Map (C7a)","embedded_feature_title":"C7a (interim): Long-term changes in the typical length of demersal and pelagic fish communities in UK waters and surrounding areas, 1980 or 1990 to 2015 or 2016","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","hide_chart":true,"hide_table":true,"indicator_name":"Healthy seas: fish and shellfish populations","indicator_reference":"C7","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES)</li>\n  <li>Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 6</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 14</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"UK (Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea)","oif_headline":"Health of our seas","oif_indicator_status":"Interim","oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - seas"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Making sure populations of key species are sustainable with appropriate age structures","Reversing the loss of marine biodiversity and, where practicable, restoring it","Ensuring that all fish stocks are recovered to and maintained at levels that can produce their maximum sustainable yield"],"oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","published":false,"reporting_status":"Interim","source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_1":"Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; International Council for Exploration of the Sea; Marine Scotland","source_organisation_2":"Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science; International Council for Exploration of the Sea; Marine Scotland","title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator tracks the health of our seas using assessments of fish populations (here separated into demersal communities \u2013 fish that live and feed on or near the bottom of seas, and pelagic communities \u2013 fish that usually feed in the surface layers of the seas). It consists of 2 metrics. The first metric looks at the size of the fish in a community (Typical Length) and the second looks at the composition of fish communities (Mean Maximum Length). Together these metrics tell us about the health and status of fish communities. A healthy fish community will be made up of species in the expected ratio of numbers of individuals, and with individual species showing the age classes and sizes consistent with a healthy population. Typical Length: a reduction in the proportion of larger, older, fish (as measured by Typical Length) of several species, suggests the top (predator) level of the food web is in poor condition. Mean Maximum Length: if the species that tend towards larger individuals are depleted and smaller-bodied species become more abundant (shown by a reduction in Mean Maximum Length), the species composition of the community can change, suggesting prolonged periods of pressure. When the community is dominated by slow growing species (as expected at low Maximum Mean Length), the size structure is limited in its ability to recover (reduced Typical Length).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. Further development of this indicator is required to incorporate the Large Fish Indicator (UK Biodiversity Indicator D1a) and assessment thresholds. An interim indicator is presented here with communities classified as demersal or pelagic.

They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description for Figures C7a and C7b\n\n### C7a) Typical Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities\n\nIn the English Channel, northern North Sea and the eastern Irish Sea, the health of the demersal fish community has improved since the 1990s, with an increasing contribution of large individuals (increasing Typical Length). In the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the proportion of individuals within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller fish (low Typical Length) indicating this community is in poorer health. In the northern North Sea, no change in the Typical Length in the pelagic fish community is evident. The Typical Length of pelagic fish generally shows no long-term change at the sub-regional level in the Celtic Seas.\n\n### C7b) Mean Maximum Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities\n\nIn the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the balance of species within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller species (low Mean Maximum Length), indicating this community is in poorer health. There has been no long-term change in Mean Maximum Length of demersal fish communities in the northern North Sea. Within the southern and central North Sea, the Mean Maximum Length of pelagic fish communities is declining suggesting the proportion of larger species is declining. There is no long-term change in the Mean Maximum Length in the northern North Sea.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"3.7.1","target_id":"3.7","sdg_goal":"3","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-01","graph_title":"Healthy seas: fish and shellfish populations"},"3-9-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Healthy seas: seafloor habitats functioning","indicator_reference":"C9","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>Water Framework Regulations \u2013 The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017, The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017, Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 14</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"UK","oif_headline":"Not applicable","oif_indicator_status":"In development","oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - seas"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Ensuring seafloor habitats are productive and sufficiently extensive to support healthy, sustainable ecosystems"],"oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","published":false,"reporting_status":"In development","source_active_1":true,"source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"source_url_1":"https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/","source_url_3":"Link to source","source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator will show changes in the natural functionality and extent of seafloor habitats able to support a healthy and productive ecosystem.

Data are currently available for representative chemicals in water and in certain species of birds of prey, fish, mammals, and mussels. Other relevant exposure data will be incorporated in the future. Further work is ongoing to improve reporting for exposure metrics and to understand better the effects of chemicals on wildlife populations and individuals.\n\nThis indicator is complementary to other indicators within the framework that give data on environmental pressures from chemicals, for example, \u2018B1 Pollution loads entering waters\u2019 and \u2018H3 Emissions of mercury and persistent organic pollutants to the environment\u2019.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. The interim indicator presented here is consistent with that published in 2021 as an experimental statistic. It covers the exposure of wildlife to chemicals in the environment and, where feasible, the risk from different types of chemicals to wildlife on land and in water. The indicator is based on chemical concentrations found in water and in different organisms \u2013 sparrowhawk/red kite, red fox (data extraction under development), freshwater fish, otter, blue mussel, dab, and harbour porpoise. It covers 3 environmental compartments: terrestrial, freshwater and marine (estuarine, coastal and offshore).\n\nThe chemicals are representative of 3 groups highlighted for attention under the 25 Year Environment Plan: persistent, bioaccumulative (the accumulation of a substance over time in a living organism) and toxic (PBT) substances, heavy metals, and pesticides and biocides. There are no new assessments to report in 2022, but we aim to update the indicator in 2024 as further data become available.\n\nThese data are being published as an experimental statistic to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator.\n\nWe would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk).\n\nFurther details on the data analysis used for the presented indicator are given in the supporting [H4 indicator report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exposure-and-adverse-effects-of-chemicals-on-wildlife-in-the-environment-interim-h4-indicator). Some data relevant to this indicator are published: [Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme \u2013 contaminant exposure](https://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/content/chemicals-monitored), [Water Quality Data Archive](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/landing), [Water quality monitoring gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry semi-quantitative screening data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/0c63b33e-0e34-45bb-a779-16a8c3a4b3f7/water-quality-monitoring-data-gc-ms-and-lc-ms-semi-quantitative-screen), [British Oceanographic Data Centre - Monitoring and Assessment National Database (MERMAN)](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/projects/data_management/uk/merman/).\n\nSince the publication of the H4 indicator report, we have been working to improve our understanding of exposure of wildlife to the chemical contaminants presented, including by analysis of archived samples to address data gaps and get a picture across environmental compartments. This will enhance our ability to report exposure trends. We are exploring methods for assessing chemical contaminant effects on wildlife to improve our understanding of environmental impacts and the potential to report these under the indicator.\n\nIn addition, we are initiating the development of metrics for emerging chemical risks. This includes integrating results from the Prioritisation and Early Warning System (PEWS) for chemicals of emerging concern, which was developed in response to the 25 Year Environment Plan to consolidate work on monitoring and horizon scanning. PEWS includes consideration of the risks posed by emerging contaminants to surface and groundwaters, biota, soils and sediments. The approach taken on emerging risks will also seek to incorporate the consideration of broader chemical topics which extend beyond PEWS.\n\n## Note on Figure H4\n\nAvailable thresholds for wildlife have been used to provide context to the most-recent national concentrations. Their use to indicate risk does not represent a compliance assessment and should not be compared with other regulatory reporting regimes which may use values with different protection goals. The approach for selecting thresholds is specific to the wildlife or environmental medium being considered because of the data available and the purpose for which it was gathered. Monitoring networks and thresholds can change over time.\n\nThe freshwater assessment for pesticides is currently based on a threshold for short-term toxic effects. In the future, the approach will be adapted to reflect risks from chronic exposure.\n\nAdditional data are available for otter, freshwater fish and red fox which cannot be incorporated into the dashboard at present, but are provided in the supporting report to this indicator. The report also contains information on spatial variation in results for freshwater metals sites and for marine fish.\n\n## Trend description for Figure H4\n\n### i) PBT substances\n\nDownward trends are observed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in marine fish (dab) and for PBDEs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in harbour porpoise. These trends are particularly evident for PBDEs.\n\nExceedance of thresholds is most significant for mercury in the freshwater and marine environments, followed by PCBs in the marine environment. The result for mercury in dab may be over-precautionary for reasons given in supporting report.\n\n### ii) Heavy metals\n\nFor heavy metals, downward trends are observed for nickel and zinc in sparrowhawks, although the data are only available up to 2014. There is an upward trend for nickel in dab, which is driven by eastern and southern coastal marine sites.\n\nThe exceedance of the nickel threshold in estuarine and coastal waters is only driven by one site. Zinc shows the highest rate of threshold exceedance of the metals in both freshwater and estuarine and coastal waters.\n\nWhile the freshwater data for heavy metals show no change in concentrations from 2014 to 2019, these results can be split into 2 types: those for sites where the waters are affected by abandoned metal mines and those for sites in other locations. Cadmium and copper exhibit downward trends for the \u2018other\u2019 sites over the assessed time period. Lead, nickel and zinc concentrations show no statistically significant change over time at such sites. For waters affected by abandoned metal mines, none of the metals included within this indicator show any statistically significant change in concentrations over time. However, their elevated levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc mean that they comprise a high proportion of those overall sites above available thresholds. The exception is for nickel, where sites in \u2018other\u2019 locations comprise the majority of those at risk.\n\n### iii) Pesticides and biocides\n\nIt is not possible to assess trends currently for pesticides and second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs). Risk is indicated for less than a quarter of sites or individuals considered for pesticides in water and SGARs in red kite.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"8.4.1","target_id":"8.4","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-04-01","graph_title":"Exposure and adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife in the environment"},"8-5-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Exposure to transport noise","indicator_reference":"H5","national_geographical_coverage":"England, potential to disaggregate the data regionally","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Environmental Noise (England) Regulations (as amended) 2006</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"England, potential to disaggregate the data regionally.","oif_headline":"Not applicable","oif_indicator_status":"In development","oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Enhancing beauty, heritage and engagement with the natural environment"],"oif_relevant_target":["None"],"oif_theme":"Biosecurity, Chemical and Noise","published":false,"reporting_status":"In development","source_active_1":false,"title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator will track changes in the exposure of people to noise from transportation sources.

The assessments of [pelagic habitats](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/pelagic-habitats/) used for this interim indicator have been reported under the updated [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marine-strategy-part-one-uk-updated-assessment-and-good-environmental-status) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the [Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic](https://www.ospar.org/convention/text) (OSPAR).\n\n## Note on Indicator C5\n\nSpatial representations and charts for the underlying data supporting this interim indicator can be accessed via the [Marine Online Assessment Tool](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/pelagic-habitats/). While the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the condition of pelagic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description for Indicator C5\n\n### C5a) Changes in plankton communities, 2004-2008 to 2009-2014\n\nThe lifeforms (functional groups of species) that make up the plankton communities in the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea changed between the starting conditions period (2004 to 2008) and the current assessment period (2009 to 2014). Prevailing environmental conditions, in particular climate change, are likely to be driving these observed changes, but the potential role of direct human activities such as fishing and nutrient inputs contributing to these changes cannot be ruled out. It is currently uncertain whether GES has been achieved.\n\n### C5b) Changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance, 2004-2008 to 2009-2014\n\nIn most areas of the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea, phytoplankton biomass has increased between the starting conditions period (2004 to 2008) and the current assessment period (2009 to 2014). Changes in zooplankton abundance varied across the 2 sub-regions assessed, with increases in some areas, decreases in others, and no change in some. This assessment identified, with a medium to high level of confidence, changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance which may have consequences on the functioning, dynamics and structure of the whole marine ecosystem. It is not yet possible to say if GES has been achieved.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment was undertaken for this indicator as it is not reported as a time series.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"3.5.1","target_id":"3.5","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-05-01","graph_title":"Diverse seas: condition of pelagic habitats"},"3-6-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Diverse seas: status of threatened and declining features","indicator_reference":"C6","national_geographical_coverage":"England","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 12</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 14</li>\n</ul>\n","oif_date_last_updated":"19 May 2022","oif_geographical_scope":"England","oif_headline":"Diversity of our seas","oif_indicator_status":"In development","oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - seas"],"oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Reversing the loss of marine biodiversity and, where practicable, restoring it"],"oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","published":false,"reporting_status":"In development","source_active_1":true,"title":"Untitled","page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator of diverse seas shows changes in the status of vulnerable features flagged for protection, either listed in national legislation or international agreements.

It will combine metrics on production (covering harvesting and subsequent preparation), management and impact on the environment. The indicator will use the data collected for the management of fish stocks to assess whether harvesting rates remain within sustainable limits. It will use equivalent data for aquaculture production. These data on harvesting and production will then be integrated with data on the impact of these activities on the wider environment together with social and economic data to provide an assessment of the sustainability of our seafood.\n\nThe data for the proportion of marine fish quota stocks of UK interest exploited above or below maximum sustainable yield that were presented in this indicator in 2019 are now presented as part of indicator C10 \u2018Productive seas: fish and shellfish stocks fished sustainably\u2019.
