The removal and proper destruction of such chemicals is necessary to prevent them contaminating recycled products or being released into the environment.\n\nInitially the indicator will use data on the amount of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) being sent for destruction. This is in line with the goal to substantially increase the amount of POPs material being destroyed or irreversibly transformed by 2030. Similar data on elimination of the use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) will be included once those data become available.\n\nWhere possible, these chemicals should be removed prior to disposal, minimising the amount of waste being sent for destruction. Data may soon become available for some of these waste types, enabling assessment of improvements in the quantity and quality of waste material available for recycling. \n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021; some data are already published via the Environment Agency's [Hazardous Waste Interrogator](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/5f4e64fc-5b19-4080-9774-113ce6a82355/2019-hazardous-waste-interrogator). Further work is required to develop the indicator, initially for POPs and subsequently for PCBs. \n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"9.5.1","target_id":"9.5","sdg_goal":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-05-01","graph_title":"Prevent harmful chemicals from being recycled"}
