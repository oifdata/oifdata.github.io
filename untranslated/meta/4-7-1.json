Plants, fungi, algae, invertebrates and soil micro-organisms are particularly important. The presence, abundance and diversity of species are key factors in determining the resilience of ecosystems to environmental changes, including climate change and disease, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. Further research is required to develop this indicator, building on the existing UK pollinator indicator and defining species groups and functions for inclusion.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the [distribution of UK pollinators](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-d1c-pollinating-insects/). Significant further research and development is required to include a range of species groups important for supporting ecosystem functions in England. The interim indicator covers the changes in the distribution (occupancy of 1 km grid squares) of bees and hoverflies in the UK.\n\n## Trend description\n\nThere was an overall decrease in the UK pollinators index from 1987 onwards. In 2017, the index had declined by 30% compared to its value in 1980. More recently however, this\ndownward trend has slowed, with the indicator decreasing by less than 2% between 2012 and 2017. These overall declines mask the trends of the individual species within the index, 49% of which have become less widespread, 19% of which have become more widespread and 32% of which have shown little or no change since the index began in 1980. By contrast, over the short term (between 2012 and 2017), a slightly greater proportion of species have become more widespread (46%) than have become less widespread (43%). \n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/f2969835c71bef7f6a54bd77a5a66e88e2eff4b5","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-28: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/950a01290f4339f1b1e3413e8e8829dee4719c4e","indicator":"4.7.1","target_id":"4.7","sdg_goal":"4","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"04-07-01","graph_title":"Species supporting ecosystem functions"}
