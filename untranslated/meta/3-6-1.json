These features include the features of conservation interest protected in Marine Protected Areas, Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act Section 41 habitats and species of principle importance for conservation, and under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), amongst others. The overall indicator will be derived from the status of the individual features.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 as further development is needed.
