We are exploring methods and data for this indicator that could include a measure of the environmental impact of some of the commodities we import (for example, on deforestation and/or water stress).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021. Between 2018 and 2020, we have undertaken research to support development of this indicator, including review of existing methodologies of global impacts indicators, tracing impact through supply chains and appropriate metrics. Based on this work, multi-regional input-output modelling has been selected as the method that will underpin this indicator. A proof of concept study has been carried out and internationally peer reviewed. This year, data are being collated and modelling is taking place This will be completed by August 2021, and so the indicator should be available to report in 2022.\n\nIn addition, we have undertaken a [comprehensive review](https://hub.jncc.gov.uk/assets/daa8e792-a36e-436b-98d7-e2f38e860650) of published platforms and tools, including their readiness and context to assess how these may be relevant to understanding the impacts of UK consumption on the environment overseas.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"10.1.1","target_id":"10.1","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01","graph_title":"Overseas environmental impacts of UK consumption of key commodities"}
