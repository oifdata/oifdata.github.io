This indicator will track change in the status of key endemic and globally threatened species found in the Overseas Territories (OTs).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022. Preliminary work has been undertaken to explore potential sources of endemic species information for the UKOTs. A detailed exploratory analysis of both the [International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/search) and [The UK's wildlife overseas : a stocktake of nature in our Overseas Territories](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/projects/the-uks-wildlife-overseas-a-stocktake-of-nature-in-our-overseas-territories/#:~:text=our%20Overseas%20Territories-,The%20UK%27s%20Wildlife%20Overseas%3A%20a%20stocktake%20of%20nature%20in%20our,all%20known%20unique%20British%20species.) has been conducted. The data sets were combined to identify endemic, native or non-native status on the Red List. Work is currently underway with individual OTs; evaluating individual species records for UKOTs and assessing endemic status.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as it is still in development.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-02","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-02: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/5c14110b0e4dda7e29733fdf57a624fc679a7740","indicator":"10.3.1","target_id":"10.3","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-03-01","graph_title":"Status of endemic and globally threatened species in the UK Overseas Territories"}
