This indicator will track change in the status of key endemic and globally threatened species found in the Overseas Territories.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021. Further work is required to develop the indicator. To-date, preliminary work has been undertaken to explore potential sources of endemic species information. This includes the [International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/).\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"10.3.1","target_id":"10.3","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-03-01","graph_title":"Status of endemic and globally threatened species in the UK Overseas Territories"}
