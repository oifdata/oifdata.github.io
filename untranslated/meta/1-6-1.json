The damaging nutrient nitrogen comes predominantly from ammonia (NH3) but partly nitrogen oxides (NOX) and long-range transport of air pollutants.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as pressure on thriving plants and wildlife. It is determined by calculating the area of sensitive habitat exceeding the internationally agreed threshold for likely damaging effects from reactive nitrogen deposition in both oxidised and reduced forms, termed the critical load. It uses modelled interpolations of atmospheric concentrations of NOX and NH3 and models deposition processes based on internationally agreed methodology.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nAssessments of nutrient nitrogen deposition are undertaken and published annually using 3-year moving average data, at [UK Air Information Resource: Trends in critical load and critical level exceedances in the UK](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/reports?report_id=1020).\n\n## Trend description for Figure A6\n\nThe percentage area of sensitive habitats in England where nutrient nitrogen deposition exceeded critical load has fallen over the latest 23 years for which data are available (98.3% in 1995 to 1997 to 95.6% in 2017 to 2019), although it has increased slightly over the last 3 data points (94.8% in 2015 to 2017 to 95.6% in 2017 to 2019).\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThere has been little or no change observed in exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems over the most recent 5-year period for which trends can be assessed (2012-2014 to 2017-2019), or over the medium and long-term time periods.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. Little or no change was also observed for exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition on ecosystems since 2018. However, this is based on only 2 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table A6: Assessment of change in exceedance of damaging levels of nutrient nitrogen deposition in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2012-2014 to 2017-2019 | -0.3 (moving average data) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2007-2009 to 2017-2019 | -0.8 (moving average data) | Little or no change |\n| Long term | 1995-1997 to 2017-2019 | -2.7 (moving average data) | Little or no change |\n\nPercent change refers to the difference seen from the first to last 3-year moving average in the specified date range.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-05","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-05","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-08-05: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/568804991dfc7a4a3e8f9040dfbd4e8a6d911e63","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-08-05: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/568804991dfc7a4a3e8f9040dfbd4e8a6d911e63","indicator":"1.6.1","target_id":"1.6","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-06-01"}
