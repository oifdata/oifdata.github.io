The damaging nutrient nitrogen comes predominantly from ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) but partly nitrogen oxides (NOx) and long-range transport of air pollutants.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as pressure on thriving plants and wildlife. It is determined by calculating the area of sensitive habitat exceeding the internationally agreed threshold for likely damaging effects from reactive nitrogen deposition in both oxidised and reduced forms, termed the critical load. It uses modelled interpolations of atmospheric concentrations of NOx and NH<sub>3</sub> and models deposition processes based on internationally agreed methodology.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nAssessments are undertaken and published annually using 3-year moving average data, at [UK Air Information Resource: Trends in critical load and critical level exceedances in the UK](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/reports?report_id=1001).\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe percentage area of sensitive habitats in England where nutrient nitrogen deposition exceeded critical load has fallen over the latest 20 years for which data are available (98.3% in 1995-97 to 95.1% in 2016-18).\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-16: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/0c271374301c5d8509e77007f2201c5359a1e9ed","indicator":"1.6.1","target_id":"1.6","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-06-01"}
