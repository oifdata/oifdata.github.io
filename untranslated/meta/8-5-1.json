It does not include neighbour and neighbourhood noise. The indicator will show the estimated number of people exposed to noise levels (in 5 decibel bands) from the most significant road, rail and air sources. Health costs (and hence burden to the economy) of noise can be estimated from health outcomes associated with noise exposure (such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular effects). The available data being explored for this indicator\u2019s development are currently derived through strategic noise mapping undertaken at 5-year intervals.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 as further work is required to develop the indicator. Data for [noise exposure](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-noise-mapping-2019) are published.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"8.5.1","target_id":"8.5","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-01","graph_title":"Exposure to transport noise"}
