The indicator is linked to the UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 6 (Seafloor Integrity). The indicator will be derived from the integration of metrics of individual broad habitat types and selected vulnerable habitats. Well-functioning seafloor habitats (physically and structurally) are both productive and sufficiently extensive, to carry out natural functionality, including the necessary ecological processes which underpin ecosystem goods and services, and are capable of supporting a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for the long term.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 as further development and testing is required. The C9 indicator is planned to draw upon models of habitat suitability and spatially overlaid activities understood to cause irreversible loss of the habitat area. Potential habitat loss of seagrass and horse mussels has already been reported under the updated [UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019)](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/physical-loss/) to assess progress towards the UK Marine Strategy target of achieving and maintaining Good Environmental Status (GES) in UK seas. Further work is required before this data is incorporated into C9, and it may also be expanded to include additional habitats in the future.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment was undertaken for this indicator as it is still in development.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-01-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-01-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/502dedeab89faeb5dda33813db8d7cbbb0d4e1cb","indicator":"3.9.1","target_id":"3.9","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-09-01","graph_title":"Healthy seas: seafloor habitats functioning"}
