The indicator is linked to the UK Marine Strategy Descriptor 6 (Seafloor Integrity). The indicator will be derived from the integration of metrics of individual broad habitat types and selected vulnerable habitats. Well-functioning seafloor habitats (physically and structurally) are both productive and sufficiently extensive, to carry out natural functionality, including the necessary ecological processes which underpin ecosystem goods and services, and are capable of supporting a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for the long term.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 as further development is needed. Analytical methods and some data on [benthic habitats](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/) are available.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"3.9.1","target_id":"3.9","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-09-01","graph_title":"Healthy seas: seafloor habitats functioning"}
