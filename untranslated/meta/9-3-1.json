The municipal waste recycling rate is the fraction of household waste and waste similar in nature and composition to household waste, which is recycled. The indicator reflects levels of everyday waste that is recycled and not sent for final disposal. Development of the Defra \u2018waste tracking\u2019 tool and further integration with data collected by local authorities will close some of the data gaps and enable collection of more comprehensive data.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in [\u2018household waste\u2019 and \u2018waste from households\u2019 recycling rates](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results). These data are already published annually as National Statistics, but further development is required to include waste that is similar in nature and composition to household waste such as non-household municipal waste. Information is available about the development of Defra\u2019s [\u2018waste tracking\u2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/waste-management-smart-tracking-of-waste-govtech-catalyst) tool.\n\n## Trend description\n\nIn the 2019/20 financial year, the recycling rate for \u2018waste from households\u2019 was 45.5%, up 3.6 percentage points on the equivalent figure for 2010/11 (when the measure was first reported). While the measure of \u2018household waste\u2019 recycling is based on a slightly broader definition of waste and therefore not directly comparable to \u2018waste from households\u2019, there has been a 34.3 percentage point increase in the waste recycling rate across the 2 measures between 2000/01 and 2019/20.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/2843000d58018c8932e3a08fb39a9de7e8b9a88a","indicator":"9.3.1","target_id":"9.3","sdg_goal":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-03-01"}
