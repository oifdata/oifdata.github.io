The government\u2019s policy statement on flood and coastal erosion risk management sets out our commitment to develop a national set of indicators by spring 2022 which will allow us to monitor trends over time to better understand the impact of our flood and coastal erosion risk management policies. As part of this work, we are reviewing the indicators proposed for the 25 Year Environment Plan to ensure they align with the outcomes of the Policy Statement and the Environment Agency\u2019s National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England.\n\nGood progress has been made through a research project commissioned to investigate ways of [measuring resilience to flooding and coastal erosion](https://www.gov.uk/flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-research-reports/measuring-resilience-to-flooding-and-coastal-change?web=1&wdLOR=c41F421B8-F095-4676-9B36-20F3CE6B8C8B). Recommendations from this work will inform further development of a resilience indicator. The [flood and coastal erosion risk management annual reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flood-and-coastal-risk-management-national-report) (from 1 April 2011) provide further context and statistics about the impacts of recent major flood events. The [National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2) sets out measures and actions to achieve a nation resilient to climate change.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as it is still in development.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-03-06","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-03-06: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/083aeb3ed3d9be503b4785a5800150083cb472d5","indicator":"6.2.1","target_id":"6.2","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-02-01","graph_title":"Communities resilient to flooding and coastal erosion"}
