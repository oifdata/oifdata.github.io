Serious pollution incidents are a pressure on the water environment. The Environment Agency uses 4 categories to determine the severity of pollution incidents. The indicator shows the number of events in each year that are in the 2 higher categories (category 1, major and category 2, significant), for example, causing death of fish, potential harm to bathers, or the temporary cessation of abstraction from a river by a drinking water provider.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published annually by the Environment Agency: [Pollution incidents data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-2016-data-on-regulated-businesses-in-england) and in [Section 5 of the Water and Sewerage Companies in England environmental performance report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/water-and-sewerage-companies-in-england-environmental-performance-report-2019); longer-term trends are available in the [State of the environment: water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment) and the [Regulating for people, the environment and growth report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-for-people-the-environment-and-growth).\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe total number of serious pollution incidents to water in England has fallen from 427 in 2009 to 266 in 2019, a drop of 38%. Category 2 (significant) incidents decreased from 361 in 2009 to 225 in 2019; category 1 (major) incidents decreased from 66 to 41 over the same 10-year period.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/d0b50f6175349552973c3fd0d8d05f09d791082e","indicator":"2.2.1","target_id":"2.2","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-02-01"}
