This indicator will show how the number of invasive non-native species entering Great Britain has been abated (reduced) by comparing a predicted trend for establishment of invasive non-native species against actual establishment. Establishment of invasive species depends on factors such as trade and climate change. The difference to the trend in actual establishment then provides a measure of the success of biosecurity measures.\n\nThe indicator will draw on data from the [Non-Native Species Information Portal](https://www.nonnativespecies.org/non-native-species/information-portal/), overseen by the \u2018Great Britain Non-Native Species Secretariat\u2019, which maintains an early detection, surveillance and monitoring mechanism that facilitates management, including rapid response. This indicator requires significant development, including deciding on which species to include and establishing a baseline for the predicted and established trend.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the number of [established non-native species in Great Britain](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b6-invasive-species/). These data are published annually as [UK Biodiversity Indicator B6 \u2013 Pressure from invasive species](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b6-invasive-species/). Further development is required to compare these data against a predicted trend.\n\n## Note on Figure H1\n\nThere are 3,248 non-native species in Great Britain, 2,016 of which are classified as established (reproducing in the wild). This indicator contains 194 non-native species that are considered to be exerting a negative impact on native biodiversity (47 freshwater species, 39 marine species and 108 terrestrial species). The majority (187) of these species are established; 6 are long-term residents but not known to breed in the wild.\n\n## Trend description for Figure H1\n\nBetween the period 1960 to 1969 and the year 2020, the number of invasive non-native species established in or along 10% or more of Great Britain\u2019s land area or coastline has increased in the freshwater, terrestrial and marine (coastal) environments, with the greatest increases in numbers having been observed in the marine and terrestrial environments.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThe H1 indicator \u2018Abatement of the number of invasive non-native species entering and establishing against a baseline\u2019 reports one cumulative data point for each 10-year period included within the indicator, unlike the majority of other indicators that report annually. Therefore, it is only possible to assess long-term trends as there are insufficient data points to establish trends over shorter time periods. An increase (or deterioration) was observed over the long term for freshwater, marine and terrestrial non-native species.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table H1i: Assessment of change in the number of invasive non-native species established across or along 10% or more of the land area or coastline of Great Britain \u2013 Freshwater\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1960-1969 to 2010-2019 | +250.0 (unsmoothed) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table H1ii: Assessment of change in the number of invasive non-native species established across or along 10% or more of the land area or coastline of Great Britain \u2013 Marine\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1960-1969 to 2010-2019 | +1350.0 (unsmoothed) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table H1iii: Assessment of change in the number of invasive non-native species established across or along 10% or more of the land area or coastline of Great Britain \u2013 Terrestrial\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1960-1969 to 2010-2019 | +117.9 (unsmoothed) | Deterioration |\n\nNote that each data point reported for this indicator represents the total over a 10-year period rather than annual data.
