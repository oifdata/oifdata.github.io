NO<sub>2</sub> arises predominantly from combustion sources such as traditionally fuelled vehicles and therefore the highest concentrations are often found at roadside locations.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as a pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the average value of the annual mean concentrations measured across Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) at all roadside locations (with greater than 75% data capture in any one year).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published annually as [National Statistics; Air Quality Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/air-quality-statistics).\n\n## Trend description\n\nConcentrations of roadside NO<sub>2</sub> in England have fallen from 60 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in 1997 to 30 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in 2019, a drop of 49% over the latest 22 years for which data are available. Although the general trend in measured NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations is decreasing and falls below the NO<sub>2</sub> limit value of 40\u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in recent years, there are hotspots of NO<sub>2</sub> exceedances which are being addressed through the NO<sub>2</sub> plans. \n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9666792be93b38ba54b2b7977ee386cd0580b8a6","indicator":"1.5.1","target_id":"1.5","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-05-01"}
