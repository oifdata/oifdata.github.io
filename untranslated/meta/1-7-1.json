Excess deposition of (NH<sub>3</sub>) on natural ecosystems causes nutrient enrichment and changes in vegetation and soils. Agriculture is the main source of (NH<sub>3</sub>) emissions to the atmosphere. \n\nThis indicator is a measure of pressure on ecosystems from air pollution. It shows the percentage of land area where interpolated measurements of ground-level air exceed the lower critical level threshold for (NH<sub>3</sub>) of 1 \u00b5g/m<sup>3</sup>.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nAssessments are undertaken and published annually using 3-year moving average data, at [UK Air Information Resource: Trends in critical load and critical level exceedances in the UK](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/reports?report_id=1001).\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe percentage of land area exposed to concentrations of NH3 that exceed critical levels (1 \u03bcg/m3) has decreased slightly from 88.9% in 2009-11 to 87.9% in 2015-17.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-16: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/22ce6fa3043f8264737fbeef8bffbf414e0b27d2","indicator":"1.7.1","target_id":"1.7","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-07-01"}
