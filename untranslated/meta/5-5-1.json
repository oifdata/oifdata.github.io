Separate statistics are available for softwood, hardwood, and both in total. This indicator helps us to better understand the levels of, and trends in, the economic productive utilisation of English timber resources as a part of sustainable forest management policies and practices.\n\nThe underlying data sources are National Statistics from Forest Research on UK Wood Production and Trade and National Forest Inventory forecasts of increase (increment) in the volume of wood that grows in England.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on the percentage of the annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested are published in the [Forestry Commission\u2019s Key Performance Indicators Reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators).\n\n## Trend description for Figure E5\n\nThe percentage of softwood growth in England which is harvested has fluctuated between 67% and 92% over the 11 years for which these data are reported, reflecting sustained active management of softwood resources. The percentage of hardwood growth which is harvested has increased slightly, although it remains much lower (between 13% and 20% over the same 11-year period), reflecting a lower level of active management of broadleaved woodland for timber supplies.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the percentage of the total annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested (hardwood and softwood combined) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020). There has been an increase (or improvement) over the medium term (2010 to 2020). The time series is not yet sufficient to make an assessment for a long-term period.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been a decrease (or deterioration) in the percentage of annual growth harvested since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table E5: Assessment of change in the percentage of annual growth of trees in English woodlands that is harvested\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2015-2020 | -0.7 (unsmoothed data) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2010-2020 | +17.1 (unsmoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\nPercent change refers to the difference seen from the first to last year in the specified date range.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"5.5.1","target_id":"5.5","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-05-01"}
