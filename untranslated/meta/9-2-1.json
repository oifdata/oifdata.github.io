These measures give a proxy for the scale of our environmental impact associated with our material consumption, while helping identify how efficiently natural resources are being used and the extent to which economic output is being decoupled from consumption of materials.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on RMC underpinning each metric are available in the [England\u2019s material footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/englands-material-footprint/englands-material-footprint) release. Data on [Nominal and real regional gross value added (balance) by industry](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossvalueaddedgva/datasets/nominalandrealregionalgrossvalueaddedbalancedbyindustry/current) and [Estimates of the population for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland) are published by the Office for National Statistics. This indicator, together with additional supporting methodology is also included within the [Resources and waste strategy for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/resources-and-waste-strategy-for-england-monitoring-and-evaluation).\n\n## Trend description for Figures J2a and J2b\n\n### J2a) Raw material consumption per capita\n\nThe average raw material footprint per capita in England (excluding fossil fuels) fell by 25.0% between 2001 and 2018. It peaked in 2004, decreased steadily until 2007 and then fell sharply during the 2008 to 2009 recession. It rose again until 2015 but has fallen over the latest 3 years for which data are available (2016 to 2018) to 11.8 tonnes per capita. Within the overall total, per capita consumption of non-metallic mineral materials, metal ores and biomass have all decreased between 2001 and 2018 (by 27%, 40% and 17% respectively).\n\n### J2b) Gross value added per kg of raw material consumption\n\nIn 2018, England generated approximately 62.0% more economic value than in 2001 (measured by GVA per unit of RMC (excluding fossil fuels), also described as resource productivity). Resource productivity measured on this basis, rose from \u00a31.53 of GVA per kg of RMC in 2001 to a peak of \u00a32.48 in 2012 before declining until 2015, and then regaining its 2012 peak in 2018.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nThere has been an improvement recorded over the medium and long term for both interim indicators for J2: J2a Raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) per capita in England and J2b Gross value added per kg of raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) in England. However, in the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2012 to 2017), RMC has begun to increase again (meaning a deterioration for the indicator) and progress has stalled for GVA per kg of RMC with an assessment of \u2018little or no change\u2019.\n\nChange since 2018 has not been assessed for this indicator as sufficient data are not yet available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table J2a: Assessment of change in raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) per capita in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2012-2017 | +10.3 (smoothed Loess) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | 2007-2017 | -12.5 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2001-2017 | -19.6 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\n### Table J2b: Assessment of change in gross value added per kg of raw material consumption (excluding fossil fuels) in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2012-2017 | -2.3 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2007-2017 | +21.4 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2001-2017 | +50.2 (smoothed Loess) | Improvement |\n\nNote that assessment categories were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Tables J2a and J2b may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere. Percent change refers to the difference seen between the first and last years in the specified date range.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-02","national_data_updated_date":"2022-09-02","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-02: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/5c14110b0e4dda7e29733fdf57a624fc679a7740","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-09-02: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/5c14110b0e4dda7e29733fdf57a624fc679a7740","indicator":"9.2.1","target_id":"9.2","sdg_goal":"9","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"09-02-01","graph_title":"Raw material consumption"}
