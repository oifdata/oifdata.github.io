These include our Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and Ramsar sites. This indicator has 2 components: (a) extent (hectares) of protected sites on land, freshwater and at sea and (b) condition of protected sites on land, water and at sea. Condition for terrestrial sites is assessed against relevant common standards agreed by the UK conservation agencies. Condition methodology for MPAs is currently under development.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for publishing in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the extent of protected areas (D2a) and condition of SSSIs (D2b) in England. Data for this interim indicator are published annually as part of [England Biodiversity Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Work is underway to improve reporting for terrestrial and freshwater sites and some further work is required to implement a methodology for assessing the condition of MPAs so that an indicator of condition (D2b) that includes all sites on land, on water and at sea can be produced.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a)\tExtent of Protected sites**\n\nThe total extent of land, water and sea protected in England through national and international protected areas increased from 1.2 million hectares in 1999 to 3.4 million\nhectares in 2020. The area of sites at sea has increased substantially, by more than 8 times since the time series began in 1999 although the majority of this increase took place between 2011 and 2020. The area of sites on land and water has remained relatively stable over time, increasing by 6% between 1999 and 2020.\n\n**b)\tCondition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest**\n\nThere has been a net decrease in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition; down from 44% in 2003 to 38.9% in 2020. The sudden drop in the area of SSSIs in favourable\ncondition from 43.2% in 2010 to 36.6% in 2011 was largely due to a more rigorous application of the \u2018Common Standard for Monitoring\u2019 protocols in assessing feature condition. However, since then, the area recorded as being in favourable condition has increased. The area of SSSIs in unfavourable recovering condition in 2020 (54.2%) is considerably higher than the 13% recorded in 2003. \n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/6f14a38f7f23d525c4e7acc2ee2f6632968a889f","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/34c676c22ce528da20503dabb2a70078d0d1fd7c","indicator":"4.2.1","target_id":"4.2","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-02-01","graph_title":"Extent and condition of protected sites \u2013 land, water and sea"}
