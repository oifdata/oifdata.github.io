The Red-listing process classifies each species into one of 10 categories including Least Concern, Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered and Regionally Extinct. A simple Red List index will be constructed to summarise the changes in numbers of species between each category over time.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021. However, baseline assessment data for approximately 10,000 species are already available, including those for Mammals, Birds, many Invertebrate groups, Vascular Plants, Lichens, Bryophytes and some Fungi. Assessments for several thousand more species are currently underway to increase the diversity of species in the baseline and the Indicator. Further development work is also underway, exploring the sensitivity of the index to such factors as the real rates of change across categories under various policy scenarios and the frequency with which assessments are repeated/updated. Data on the extinction risk faced by individual species in GB are published on the [JNCC website](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/conservation-designations-for-uk-taxa/), whilst information on the derivation of a Red List Index is available on the [IUCN website](https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/red-list-index).\nAvailable data on changes in abundance and distribution of native species are presented in indicators D4 Relative abundance and/or distribution of widespread species, D6 Relative abundance and/or distribution of priority species and D7 Species supporting ecosystem functions.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"4.5.1","target_id":"4.5","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-05-01","graph_title":"Conservation status of our native species"}
