River flows and groundwater levels are sustainable when they support ecology that is only slightly impacted by human activity. The indicator is affected by changes in water use, both in relation to leakage and personal consumption (see E8 Efficient use of water). This indicator is also sensitive to effects of future climate change on rainfall and consumption and shows the need for adaptation.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nData on [WFD Cycle 2 site classifications](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/a2a10b3a-2049-48ba-9ab5-fbc3ae26c9f9/wfd-river-canal-and-surface-water-transfer-water-bodies-cycle-2-classification-2019) are published as part of the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 and the [Abstraction Reform Report 2019](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/abstraction-reform-report-2019).\n\n## Trend description \n\nIn 2019, 85% of surface water bodies supported required flow standards and 73% of groundwater bodies were sustainable. Both of these results represent a one percentage point increase from the equivalent figures reported in 2018. In 2017, when the timeseries began, 82% of surface water bodies supported required flow standards and 72% of groundwater bodies were sustainable.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-21: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fc46292154869531110d50bb35f5cb141ae9705c","indicator":"2.5.1","target_id":"2.5","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-05-01","graph_title":"Water bodies achieving sustainable abstraction criteria"}
