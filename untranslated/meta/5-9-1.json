It will combine metrics on production (covering harvesting and subsequent preparation), management and impact on the environment. The indicator will use the data collected for the management of fish stocks to assess whether harvesting rates remain within sustainable limits. It will use equivalent data for aquaculture production. These data on harvesting and production will then be integrated with data on the impact of these activities on the wider environment together with social and economic data to provide an assessment of the sustainability of our seafood.\n\nThe data for the proportion of marine fish quota stocks of UK interest exploited above or below maximum sustainable yield that were presented in this indicator in 2019 are now presented as part of indicator C10 \u2018Productive seas: fish and shellfish stocks fished sustainably\u2019. This revision took place because the data are specific to fish and shellfish rather than reflecting the health of the marine ecosystem as a whole.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022. Data on [sustainably harvested fish stocks](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-b2-sustainable-fisheries/) are already published annually. However, further work is required to incorporate these data and others into this broader indicator.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as it is still in development.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-01-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-01-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/502dedeab89faeb5dda33813db8d7cbbb0d4e1cb","indicator":"5.9.1","target_id":"5.9","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-09-01","graph_title":"Percentage of our seafood coming from healthy ecosystems, produced sustainably"}
