As well as being vital for food production, agriculture helps to shape the landscape, providing important recreational, spiritual and other cultural benefits. This indicator shows annual changes in land used for agriculture in 3 categories: grassland (including sole rough grazing); crops (including horticulture and perennial crops); and uncropped arable (land left fallow or under environmental management). Agricultural production and the associated land use and management are key drivers of the environmental impacts from the sector. A key policy challenge is to de-couple production from environmental impact. The indicator may be considered a measure of pressure on the environment, a measure of condition of the land asset, or a measure of service/benefit we derive from the land. The indicator is included in the framework to provide contextual information.\n\n*Food which can be produced in the climatic conditions of the UK.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on the [structure of the agricultural industry](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/structure-of-the-agricultural-industry) in England are already published annually as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description\n\nAfter a period of decline in the late 1980s, land use by agriculture has remained relatively stable. Similarly, the split between crops and grazing has remained relatively constant over this time, with grassland accounting for around half of agricultural land (52% in 2020) and crops a little under half (45% in 2020).\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/2fa49a5f872a446093420c9cb50d9236d1209748","indicator":"5.1.1","target_id":"5.1","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-01-01"}
