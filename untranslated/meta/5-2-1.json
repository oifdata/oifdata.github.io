This represents a valuable output from the land and other resources used. Volume of agricultural production is considered to be a provisioning service provided by a range of natural capital assets (land, water, air, species and ecological communities). This indicator shows annual changes in the index of output volume which provides an overall measure of total production across the wide range of agricultural commodities. The index is calculated using agreed international standards. Farm practices and the use of inputs (particularly fertilisers and pesticides) directly influence the environmental pressures from farming including the quality, composition and availability of habitats and impact on air, water and soils. This indicator should therefore be viewed alongside the indicator E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the volume of agricultural production in the UK. Indicators and data on [total factor productivity](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-for-england-by-farm-type) for England by farm type are published as Experimental Statistics, but the National Statistics publication on [total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-of-the-agricultural-industry) is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description\n\nAfter a period of sustained increase from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s the overall volume of outputs has remained relatively stable, with some variation from year to year. Annual variations are generally driven by external factors, in particular weather, affecting growing and harvest and the variation in cropping driven by prices.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/d87cdf0a2612bc08bbb1ac451363f8c9e3bf7693","indicator":"5.2.1","target_id":"5.2","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-02-01"}
