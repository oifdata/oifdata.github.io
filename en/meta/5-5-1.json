Separate statistics are available for softwood, hardwood, and both in total. This indicator helps us to better understand the levels of, and trends in, the economic productive utilisation of English timber resources as a part of sustainable forest management policies and practices. The underlying data sources are National Statistics from Forest Research on UK Wood Production and Trade and National Forest Inventory forecasts of increase (increment) in the volume of wood that grows in England.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published in the Forestry Commission\u2019s annual [Key Performance Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators) report.\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe percentage of softwood growth in England which is harvested has fluctuated between 67% and 92% over the 10 years for which these data are reported, reflecting sustained active management of softwood resources. The percentage of hardwood growth which is harvested has increased slightly, although it remains much lower (between 13% and 19% over the same 10-year period), reflecting a lower level of active management of broadleaved woodland for timber supplies.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/624256fdeac322777c8e3ab0a64efe698ccebeec","indicator":"5.5.1","target_id":"5.5","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-05-01"}
