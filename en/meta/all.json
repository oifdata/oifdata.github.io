This indicator will show how the number of invasive non-native species entering Great Britain has been abated (i.e. reduced) by comparing a predicted trend for establishment of invasive non-native species against actual establishment. Establishment of invasive species depends on factors such as trade and climate change. The difference to the trend in actual establishment then provides a measure of the success of biosecurity measures.\n\nThe indicator will draw on data from the Non-Native Species Information Portal, overseen by the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat, which maintains an early detection, surveillance and monitoring mechanism that facilitates management, including rapid response.

This indicator shows annual changes in the index of output volume which provides an overall measure of total production across the wide range of agricultural commodities.

Protected areas are a key tool for conserving the globally significant and, in many cases endemic, biodiversity found in the Territories. This indicator will have 2 components: (a) extent and (b) condition of UKOT protected areas. It will show changes in the coverage of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) across the UKOTs, from a 2020 baseline. The baseline is calculated using UKOT protected area extent data provided by UKOT governments. The areas are aggregated across UKOTs and geographical regions and percent coverage is calculated for the land and marine environments separately. The indicator will also demonstrate the condition of protected areas in the UKOTs, using aspects of protected area condition that can be assessed cost-effectively.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the extent of protected areas and OECMs across the UKOTs. These extent data are reported for the first time in 2021 as an Experimental Statistic; information on how the data have been obtained and how the statistics have been calculated is available in [JNCC Report No. 679](https://hub.jncc.gov.uk/assets/d7207246-4903-4e87-9c19-65cf016accd5). The data are being published as Experimental Statistics in order to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator. We would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk). Research has been commissioned to support development of the condition aspect of this indicator, including exploring the feasibility of using Earth Observation to assess the condition of protected areas.\n\n## Note\n\n\nThe indicator includes protected areas and OECMs formally established up to and including 2020, where these are implemented for and/or deliver biodiversity conservation. Extent is measured using the outer boundaries of sites; the indicator does not assess the extent of management measures within protected areas and OECMs. UK Hydrographic Office data are used to map UK Overseas Territories\u2019 seas in the absence of formally agreed maritime boundaries. \n\nThe \u2018All UKOTs\u2019 category includes 13 UK Overseas Territories; the British Antarctic Territory is not included. \u2018Mediterranean\u2019 includes the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and Gibraltar. \u2018Indian and Pacific Oceans\u2019 includes British Indian Ocean Territory and Pitcairn Islands group. \u2018South Atlantic\u2019 includes the Falkland Islands, St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. \u2018Wider Caribbean\u2019 includes Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nA new large Marine Protection Zone covering 687,223 km<sup>2</sup> of Tristan da Cunha\u2019s waters was announced in November 2020. Once formally designated, this site will substantially increase marine protected area coverage across all UKOTs and within the South Atlantic region. These increases will be reflected in a future update to this indicator.\n\n## Trend description\n\nProtected areas and OECMs cover nearly two-thirds (63%) of the marine environment in the UKOTs but a much smaller proportion (4.7%) of the terrestrial environment. Given the UKOTs\u2019 combined marine area is more than 300 times larger than the land area (approximately 5,748,600 km<sup>2</sup> of sea compared to 17,738 km<sup>2</sup> of land), the extent of marine protection (3.62 million km<sup>2</sup>) is also 4 orders of magnitude larger than for the terrestrial environment (832 km<sup>2</sup>). There are marked differences in protected area coverage between regions, with the 2 UKOTs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans protecting the greatest proportions of the terrestrial and marine environment (collectively) compared to other regions.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-27: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/358d92e95d2cfd72d1054d9a70b773ee19c48b75","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-18: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/7e1f6c347ee108944af81efa3687ab7d4ce96b11","indicator":"10.4.1","target_id":"10.4","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-04-01"},"1-5-1":{"indicator_reference":"A5","indicator_name":"Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations","oif_theme":"Air","oif_headline":"Not applicable","computation_units":"Annual mean concentration (\u00b5g/m3)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Defra","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env02-air-quality-statistics","reporting_status":"Final","national_geographical_coverage":"England; data from individual monitoring sites are also available.","published":true,"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","graph_continuous_error":{"target":"Annual mean concentrations of NO2 - roadside","upper":"Upper_CI_bound","lower":"Lower_CI_bound","legend":"95% confidence interval"},"data_start_values":[{"field":"Measure","value":"Annual mean concentrations of NO2 - roadside"},{"field":"Measure","value":"Lower_CI_bound"},{"field":"Measure","value":"Upper_CI_bound"}],"precision":[{"decimals":2}],"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","graph_title":"A5, Roadside nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations in England, 1997 to 2019","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean air"],"oif_relevant_target":["Meeting legally binding targets to reduce emissions of five damaging air pollutants"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - atmosphere"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010.

In addition, labour and land is required as well as depreciation of capital. Minimising the use of these inputs is an important policy driver to improve productivity and hence improve profitability whilst reducing the environmental impacts of farming. Farm practices and the use of inputs (particularly fertilisers and pesticides) directly influence the environmental pressures from farming including the quality, composition and availability of habitats and impact on air, water and soils. Volume of inputs may therefore be considered an indirect measure of pressure on a range of natural capital assets. This indicator should be viewed alongside the indicator E2 Volume of agricultural production and other indicators in the framework relating to the condition of natural capital assets. The index of the volume of inputs is an overall measure of the total inputs used with price effects removed. This includes all inputs including intermediate consumption, land, labour and depreciation of capital.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form.

Beach litter surveys are completed annually or quarterly and cover a representative number of beaches. Data from trawl surveys, typically carried out for fish stock assessments, are used to monitor the amount of litter on the seafloor. After each tow all litter items are emptied from the net and counted and classified. Beached fulmars or individuals accidently killed are collected as part of a monitoring programme in the Greater North Sea to assess the plastics found in their stomachs. Fulmars forage exclusively at sea, generally at the surface of the water. The amount of plastic they ingest can be used as a proxy for the abundance of floating litter in their environment and how this is changing. Indicators for seafloor litter, beach litter and litter found in Fulmar stomachs have been developed and expert groups are working to improve the data. Additional monitoring programmes are being developed to record the amount of microplastics in sediment and in biota. \n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows aspects of litter in the marine in environment. The assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019). Data, analytical methods and assessment on [Marine litter](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/pressures-from-human-activities/marine-litter/) are available. Further methodological development of this indicator is required and the indicator\u2019s format will evolve.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of marine litter. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a)\tBeach litter**\n\nThe average total abundance of beach litter items per 100 m of coast varies considerably around the UK with greater quantities being recorded in the Celtic Seas than the Greater North Sea. After showing some decrease from 2011 to 2013, beach litter levels in the Celtic Seas whilst fluctuating have risen to greater than the 2008 levels. In the Greater North Sea there has been an increase in beach litter levels. Water currents, weather conditions, and prevailing wind conditions can have an influence on the deposition and retention of beach litter and therefore beach litter abundance. \n\n**b)\tFulmars**\n\nFrom 2004 to 2014 approximately 60% of surveyed fulmars were found to have more than 0.1 g of plastic found in their stomachs. This reflects the abundance of floating litter in their environment. \n\n**c)\tSeafloor litter**\n\nFrom sampling UK seafloor litter to date higher amounts of litter and plastic have been found per km<sup>2</sup> of seafloor in the Greater North Sea compared to the Celtic Seas. There were also higher amounts of seafloor litter in the southern parts of the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, which could be a result of increasing human pressures.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9a6e71d38ab84cc2ba3404f22b44899e144e50eb","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/28a2d46ee0bbc3d81b0f3e0b12cefa35c6fed077","indicator":"3.1.1","target_id":"3.1","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-01","graph_title":"Clean seas: marine litter"},"2-1-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"B1","oif_theme":"Water","oif_headline":"Not applicable","reporting_status":"Interim","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"RID data","source_organisation_1":"Environment Agency","source_url_1":"https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/pressures-human-activities/contaminants/","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Pollution loads entering waters","graph_titles":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","title":"B1a (interim), Riverine inputs of selected metals into English tidal waters, 2008 to 2019"},{"series":"B1b (interim)","title":"B1b (interim), Riverine inputs of selected nutrients into English tidal waters, 2008 to 2019"}],"data_start_values_by_series":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","field":"Metal","value":"Cadmium"},{"series":"B1a (interim)","field":"Metal","value":"Copper"},{"series":"B1a (interim)","field":"Metal","value":"Lead"},{"series":"B1a (interim)","field":"Metal","value":"Mercury"},{"series":"B1a (interim)","field":"Metal","value":"Zinc"},{"series":"B1b (interim)","field":"Nutrient","value":"Total Nitrogen"},{"series":"B1b (interim)","field":"Nutrient","value":"ortho-Phosphate"}],"graph_annotations":[{"series":"","preset":"base_line"}],"national_geographical_coverage":"England, data for individual sites, water bodies and catchments are also available.","graph_sources":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","source":"Environment Agency"},{"series":"B1b (interim)","source":"Environment Agency"}],"graph_notes":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","note":""},{"series":"B1b (interim)","note":""}],"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","units":"Index (2008 = 100)"},{"series":"B1b (interim)","units":"Index (2008 = 100)"}],"geographical_area":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","area":"England"},{"series":"B1b (interim)","area":"England"}],"graph_limits":[{"series":"B1a (interim)","minimum":0,"maximum":250,"stepSize":50},{"series":"B1b (interim)","minimum":0,"maximum":110,"stepSize":10}],"oif_relevant_target":["Improving at least three-quarters of our waters to be close to their natural state","Reaching or exceeding objectives for rivers, lakes, coastal and ground waters that are specially protected, whether for biodiversity or drinking water as per our River Basin Management Plans","Restoring 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their wildlife value for the long term"],"oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy Regulations</li>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017</li>\n</ul>","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean and plentiful water","Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_geographical_scope":"England; data for individual sites, water bodies and catchments are also available.","oif_indicator_status":"Interim","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","page_content":"## Short description\n\nThis indicator will track changes in the inputs and discharges of selected contaminants such as nutrients and some toxic chemicals to rivers or directly to the sea, for example through sewage pipelines or activities such as agriculture inputting substances directly.  \n\nIt will focus on the discharge/emission of contaminants that adversely affect the quality and uses of receiving waters and potentially increase the costs of water treatment.

Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.

It can also be considered as pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the annual population-weighted mean concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the air, assessed as background concentrations per 1 km square. The population-weighted mean concentration is used as a measure of the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on the health of the total population. Greater weighting is given to concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in urban areas to reflect the higher population density as those concentrations will affect a greater number of people. In addition, people living in urban areas are generally exposed to greater levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> than those living in rural areas.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published annually at [UK Air Information Resource, Modelled background pollution data](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data).\n\n## Note\n\nPM<sub>2.5</sub> annual mean concentrations are estimated annually for every square kilometre of the UK through the Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) model.

There is considerable annual variation, this variation being mainly driven by variation in output volumes.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/322a02da9ff9750e39d24dab956ec313fbe10ae2","indicator":"5.4.1","target_id":"5.4","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-04-01"},"2-5-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"B5","oif_theme":"Water","oif_headline":"Water and water environment","reporting_status":"Final","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Water bodies achieving sustainable abstraction criteria","national_geographical_coverage":"England; data for individual water bodies are also available.","data_footnote":"A graph is not yet presented for this indicator as data are currently only available for 3 years.","computation_units":"Percentage of water bodies","source_organisation_1":"Environment Agency","source_url_1":"https://data.gov.uk/dataset/92659478-0d30-4484-bfef-6abfbe72b4a5/wfd-cycle-2-site-classifications-2016","oif_indicator_status":"Final","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean and plentiful water","Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Reducing the damaging abstraction of water from rivers and groundwater, ensuring that by 2021 the proportion of water bodies with enough water to support environmental standards increases from 82% to 90% for surface water bodies and from 72% to 77% for groundwater bodies","Restoring 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their wildlife value for the long term"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - freshwater"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 6.4.2</li>\n  <li>May support Climate Change Risk Assessment and the Adaptation Sub-Committee\u2019s assessment of the National\n  Adaptation Programme, under the Climate Change Act (2008)</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"England; data for individual water bodies are also available.","hide_chart":true,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Water body category","value":"Surface water"},{"field":"Water body category","value":"Groundwater"}],"oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","page_content":"## Short description \n\nThis indicator shows changes in the percentage of surface waters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries) and groundwater (including wetlands fed by groundwater) where sustainable abstraction criteria are met.

The indicator will have 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those widespread species for which relevant data are available; and, (b) changes in the distribution (the number of 1 km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of widespread species for which relevant data are available.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the abundance of breeding wild birds, widespread butterflies and bats in England. The expectation is that this indicator will be expanded to include more species groups and habitat types in the future. Some data are already published annually elsewhere ([wild birds](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/wild-bird-populations-in-england), [butterflies and bats](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators)), and methods for analysing trends in plants are being developed. Further work is required to combine and present trends for different species groups and habitat types within the abundance and distribution measures in this indicator.\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England have both declined between 1970 and 2019; the former by almost 40%, the latter by 60%. Farmland birds experienced steeper declines during the late 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s because of rapid changes in farmland management.\n\nThe indicators for widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland in England also declined between 1990 and 2010, the former more steeply than the latter. However, in recent years, the woodland butterfly indicator has shown little change while the farmland butterfly indicator has increased to a figure close to its 1990 baseline value.\n\nThe indicator for widespread bats in England has increased by approximately 40% since the turn of the century. The bat species within this index vary in their habitat requirements, but all occur in farmland and woodland landscapes.\n\nWhilst these overall trends are clear from the charts, they mask the trends for individual species within each index \u2013 some farmland and woodland species trends have increased whereas others have either remained the same or decreased over time. Further details on these individual species trends are available in the source documents.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/67f1bff8bc2979793f40b2462fb3cb01bc4d0435","indicator":"4.4.1","target_id":"4.4","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-04-01","graph_title":"Relative abundance and/or distribution of widespread species"},"5-8-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"E8","oif_theme":"Natural Resources","oif_headline":"Not applicable","reporting_status":"Final","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"bar","graph_titles":[{"series":"E8a","title":"E8a, Water leakage in England, 2000/01-2002/03 to 2017/18-2019/20"},{"series":"E8b","title":"E8b, Per capita water consumption in England, 2000/01-2002/03 to 2017/18-2019/20"}],"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"E8a","units":"Total leakage (megalitres/day)"},{"series":"E8b","units":"Weighted average consumption (litres/person/day)"}],"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Efficient use of water","data_footnote":"Data represent figures for April to March (financial years) and are presented as 3-year moving averages.

For mercury, which is covered by the Minamata Convention, combustion sources are particularly significant, and information on emissions is provided annually by larger industrial sites. Other major sources of mercury to air will be gathered from different data sources.\n\nPOPs are chemicals that are extremely persistent in the environment, become widely distributed geographically, are able to accumulate in the tissues of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health and the environment. POPs within this indicator refers to pollutants listed under Annex C (unintentional produced) of the Stockholm Convention. The Convention covers a range of substances spanning industrial uses, pesticides, and unintentionally produced substances.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in a final format in 2021. Further development is required to bring data together from a number of different sources and further work is underway to disaggregate these data to an England-only level. An interim indicator is presented here that shows annual UK emissions of (a) mercury from larger industrial sites and crematoria, and (b) 7 unintentionally produced POP substances (as listed in the Stockholm Convention Annex C): polychlorinated biphenyls; dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls; dioxins and furans; hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated naphthalenes; pentachlorophenol; and pentachlorobenzene from a wide range of sources to air, land, and water. Some information is already published: [Persistent Organic Pollutants Multimedia Emissions Inventory](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=19672&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=persistent%20organic%20pollutants&GridPage=1&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10#Description), [National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/data/data-selector), [Pollutant Release and Transfer Registry](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-pollutant-release-and-transfer-register-prtr-data-sets) and [National Reports for the Stockholm Convention](http://www.pops.int/Countries/Reporting/NationalReports/tabid/3668/Default.aspx).\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the currently available data for POPs predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they reflect the most recently available information on the emissions of the 7 POPs included within this indicator and enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan. Updated data, including results for 2017 and 2018, are expected to be published in Summer 2021; these new data will be reflected in future indicator updates.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a) Emissions of mercury to air, land and water**\n\nIn 2018, UK emissions of mercury from larger industrial sites and crematoria totalled 2,465 kg, with larger industrial sites accounting for 75% of this total.\n\n**b) Emissions of persistent organic pollutants to air, land and water**\n\nUK emissions of all 7 POPs included within this indicator have fallen between 2000 and 2016.\n\nDioxins and furans are a family of chemicals strongly associated with thermal processes linked to combustion (particularly of waste) and manufacture of metals. Their emissions were already reduced by 60% between 1990 and 2000, with improvements in technology and tighter environmental regulations contributing to this fall. Between 2000 and 2010, emissions of dioxins and furans fell by a further 30% but have since levelled out, with emissions post-2010 largely linked to more diffuse sources such as domestic combustion of solid fossil fuels, accidental fire, and illegal burning of waste.\n\nBy 2013, emissions of hexachlorobenzene had fallen to 26% of their 2000 baseline figure but have risen annually between 2013 and 2016 to reach 42% of emissions in 2000. This is linked to waste incineration and the increasing use of a specific pesticide (chlorothalonil) for which it is a by-product. Emissions of pentachlorophenol have fallen consistently since 2000 to reach 39% of their baseline figure in 2016. Emissions of the remaining 4 POPs have followed a very similar pattern to each other, falling sharply in the first 10 years and then levelling out to between 13% and 18% of their baseline figures in 2016. In particular for polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, this relates to remaining final in-use stocks of heat-transfer fluids in di-electric equipment in the energy transmission networks.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/a569830354911cffe813fc32f9a2355021949306","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-01: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/6baba752de79735a56745fb5062fffaad90ee2ab","indicator":"8.3.1","target_id":"8.3","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-03-01","graph_title":"Emissions of mercury and persistent organic pollutants to the environment"},"4-6-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"D6","oif_theme":"Wildlife","oif_headline":"Not applicable","reporting_status":"Interim","oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Taking action to recover threatened, iconic or economically important species of animals, plants and fungi, and where possible to prevent human induced extinction or loss of known threatened species in England and the Overseas Territories"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets -

They were identified to support UK conservation planning and are published and maintained by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Priority species are used as the reference source to produce statutory species lists of principal conservation importance. Such lists are published by the Secretary of State under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. There are over 940 priority species recognised in England.\n\nThis indicator has 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those priority species for which suitable abundance data are available; and, (b) changes in distribution (the number of 1 km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of those priority species for which distribution data are available.\n\nThe taxonomic coverage of this indicator is limited at present. The relative abundance measure includes priority birds, butterflies, some mammals (one hare and 5 bats) and moths but does not currently include plants, fungi, amphibians, reptiles, fish or invertebrates other than butterflies and moths; the distribution measure includes priority species of bryophytes, lichens, insects and other invertebrates but does not currently include amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish or mammals.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. Trends for the relative abundance and distribution of priority species at a UK-level are already presented annually in the [UK Biodiversity Indicators](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/uk-biodiversity-indicators-2020/); however, further work has been undertaken to develop equivalent measures at an England-only level. The results of this work are presented here for the first time in 2021 as a revised interim indicator. Information on how these data have been obtained and how the statistics have been calculated is available on the [Defra science portal](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=20501&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=NR0178&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10#Description). The report includes a technical background document that describes the data sources and methods in detail, and spreadsheets that contain a list of species within each index together with the data behind the indices. Methods are being developed to refine the future reporting of this indicator and to expand the taxonomic coverage. These methods are still undergoing peer review and user feedback is invited via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk).\n\n## Note\n\nOf the more than 940 species in the priority species list for England, 149 have robust quantitative time-series data on relative abundance and 181 have suitable distribution data. The relative abundance measure comprises Birds (44), Butterflies (21), Mammals (6) and Moths (78); the distribution measure includes Bees (13), Bryophytes (9), Lichens (16), Moths (93), Spiders, (9) and Wasps (7). Approximately 60 species of moths appear in both the relative abundance and distribution measures; the remaining species within this indicator are unique to one or other of the measures because they are drawn from different data sources. The abundance datasets are generated largely from data collected by national monitoring schemes, whereas the distribution data are collated through the Biological Records Centre and include contributions from a wide range of national recording schemes (see the technical background document referenced in the \u2018Readiness and links to data\u2019 section for further detail).\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a) Changes in abundance of priority species**\n\nBy 2018, the index of relative abundance of priority species in England had declined to 17.7% of its base-line value in 1970, a statistically significant decrease. Over this long-term period, 7% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 83% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2013 and 2018, the relative abundance index\ndeclined from 21.3 to 17.7 (17% of the 2013 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 20% of species showed a strong or weak increase\nand 56% showed a strong or weak decline.\n\n**b) Changes in distribution of priority species**\n\nBy 2016, the index of distribution of priority species in England decreased to 84, a statistically significant decrease of 16% of the 1970 value. Over this long-term period, 24%\nof species showed a strong or weak increase and 38% showed a strong or weak decline. More recently, between 2011 and 2016, the distribution index declined from 92.3 to 83.7 (9% of the 2011 value), again a statistically significant decrease. Over this short-term period, 13% of species showed a strong or weak increase and 59% showed a strong or weak decline.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-27: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/42227be85057659ca3af12396affa3a71ebb3d11","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-24: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/a059afb057d2e1096a51d5ff54ede221874afd40","indicator":"4.6.1","target_id":"4.6","sdg_goal":"4","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"04-06-01","graph_title":"Relative abundance and distribution of priority species in England"},"4-7-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"D7","oif_theme":"Wildlife","oif_headline":"Nature on land and water","reporting_status":"Interim","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_types":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","type":"line"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","type":"bar"}],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":[{"series":"D7ii (interim)"}],"graph_category_order":{"D7ii (interim)":{"Strong decline":0,"Weak decline":1,"Little or no change":2,"Weak increase":3,"Strong increase":4}},"graph_category_color":{"D7i (interim)":{"Indicator (mean occupancy)":"#008938","90% credible interval - maximum":"#81ed93","90% credible interval - minimum":"#81ed93"},"D7ii (interim)":{"Strong decline":"#28779f","Weak decline":"#94d7ff","Little or no change":"#e1e1e1","Weak increase":"#81ed93","Strong increase":"#008938"}},"graph_titles":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","title":"D7i (interim), Change in the distribution of pollinators in the UK, 1980 to 2017"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","title":"D7ii (interim), Long-term and short-term changes in the distribution of individual pollinator species in the UK, 1980 to 2017"}],"computation_units_by_series":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","units":"Index (1980 = 100)"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","units":"Percentage of species"}],"graph_annotations":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","preset":"base_line"}],"data_start_values_by_series":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","field":"Trendline","value":"Indicator (mean occupancy)"},{"series":"D7i (interim)","field":"Trendline","value":"90% credible interval - minimum"},{"series":"D7i (interim)","field":"Trendline","value":"90% credible interval - maximum"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","field":"Category","value":"Strong decline"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","field":"Category","value":"Weak decline"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","field":"Category","value":"Little or no change"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","field":"Category","value":"Weak increase"},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","field":"Category","value":"Strong increase"}],"graph_continuous_error":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","target":"Indicator (mean occupancy)","upper":"90% credible interval - maximum","lower":"90% credible interval - minimum","legend":"90% credible intervals (measures of uncertainty)"}],"graph_limits":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","minimum":0,"maximum":120},{"series":"D7ii (interim)","minimum":0,"maximum":100}],"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"graph_notes":[{"series":"D7i (interim)","note":"This composite measure of distribution includes 148 wild bee and 229 hoverfly species; the total number of species included in the index can vary between years and hence this indicator may not be directly comparable to those appearing in previous publications.

An interim indicator is presented here that shows frequency of visits to natural spaces in England. The interim indicator is derived from data collected as part of the [Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitor-of-engagement-with-the-natural-environment-survey-purpose-and-results) survey. While the impacts of COVID-19 on public engagement with the natural environment are likely to be considerable, they are not reflected in the results of this interim indicator because the most recently available full-year data from the MENE survey predates the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInformation on changes in public engagement with nature is now gathered by Natural England using [The People and Nature Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/people-and-nature-survey-for-england) for England. This new survey, which began collecting data in April 2020, builds on the MENE survey. The first full year of data collection was completed at the end of March 2021; data will now be analysed, and indicators will be finalised. Initial results from 2020, together with further information on the survey methods, outputs and the full questionnaire, are available on The People and Nature Survey homepage. The People and Nature Survey team welcome collaboration and feedback via their [user hub](https://people-and-nature-survey-defra.hub.arcgis.com/).\n\nA revised indicator, based on results from the new People and Nature Survey, is intended to be published in the Outcome Indicator Framework report in 2022. Considerable work is underway to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on the trends for this revised indicator as part of its development; insight and feedback from stakeholders via the [user hub](https://people-and-nature-survey-defra.hub.arcgis.com/) is also welcome as part of this work.\n\n## Note\n\nMENE collected data using a face-to-face survey, which means the results presented in this interim indicator are not directly comparable to those obtained via the new People and Nature Survey which uses online methods.

The assessments of marine mammals will be based on trends in the abundance of harbour seals; Atlantic grey seal pup production; and the abundance of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). The assessments of marine birds will be based on the proportion of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds that have met abundance targets, which were set to inform progress towards Good Environmental Status (GES). The GES assessments of marine mammals and birds were used in the updated UK Marine Strategy (UKMS) Part One (2019) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR). \n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form as some further development is being undertaken. An interim indicator is presented here that shows (a) changes in the abundance of harbour seals and the production of Atlantic grey seal pups in the north-east and south-east of England, and (b) changes in the abundance of breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas ([OSPAR marine regions](https://www.ospar.org/convention/the-north-east-atlantic) including data from neighbouring countries). The assessments of [seals](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/seals/) and marine [birds](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/birds/) used for this interim indicator have been reported at a UK scale under the updated UKMS Part One (2019). The assessment for seals used data from 1994 to 2014, the most recent data on seals presented in the charts below are published by the [Special Committee on Seals (SCOS)](http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/research-policy/scos/). The indicator will be kept under review during the development of \u2018D5 Conservation status of our native species\u2019 as some elements of this indicator may ultimately be included in D5 instead. Cetaceans are not yet included in this indicator, but they will be once more definitive assessments can be made. Whale and dolphin species were assessed in the UKMS Part One (2019) using [data on abundance](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/cetaceans/). However, for most species, trends in abundance could not be determined because there were an insufficient number of population estimates.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the data currently available for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds in this interim indicator predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of changes in GES of seals and marine birds. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nTrends in harbour seal abundance are derived from counts of seals on land in August of each year when they are moulting; Atlantic grey seal status is assessed using counts of pups that estimate pup production at major breading sites. Targets for GES were met if harbour seal abundance and Atlantic grey seal pup production: a) declined by less than an average of 1% per year during 2009 to 2014, or b) decreased by less than 25% since the baseline year (1992 or start of time series, if later). The UKMS Part One (2019) GES assessment for seals covered the Celtic Seas and Greater North Sea.\n\nGES is achieved for breeding seabirds and wintering waterbirds if 75% or more species meet or exceed their thresholds for relative abundance (the dashed horizontal line on Figure C3b). The relative abundance of a species is the annual abundance expressed as a proportion of the baseline, which was taken as the abundance at the start of the timeseries in 1992. Thresholds for relative abundance were set to define GES: greater than 80% of the baseline for species that lay one egg and greater than 70% of the baseline for species that lay more than one egg.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a)\tSeals**\n\nTrends in harbour seal numbers in eastern England have been largely positive since the mid-1990s, although they appear to have levelled off and then fallen between 2015 and 2019. In the south-east, where the majority of the England population are found, numbers have fluctuated showing an increase from 2,793 in 1995 to 4,944 in 2018 followed by a sharp decline to 3,752 in 2019. Numbers are much lower in north-east England; they have shown a steady increase from 45 animals in 1994 to 91 in 2015 before declining to 79 in 2019. The UKMS Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1994 to 2014 concluded that because of declines in Scotland, GES had not been achieved for harbour seal abundance in the UK Greater North Sea sub-region (which includes seal populations in the north-east and south-east England). \nIn south-east England annual Atlantic grey seal pup production has risen exponentially from just 200 pups in 1992 to 7,902 pups in 2019. In north-east England the rise in pup production has been steadier, from 985 pups in 1992 to 2,823 in 2019. The UKMS Part One (2019) assessment based on the period 1992 to 2014 concluded that GES for Atlantic grey seals has been achieved in the Greater North Sea.\n\n**b)\tMarine birds**\n\nThe proportion of seabird species meeting thresholds for breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas has remained stable since 2012 but remains below the 75% target (59% in the Greater North Sea in 2014 and 63% in the Celtic Seas in 2015). The UKMS (2019) assessment concluded GES for breeding seabirds has not been achieved in the Greater North Sea or Celtic Seas.\nThe proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds for non-breeding abundance in the Greater North Sea has declined sharply, but is still on target (78% in 2013/14); the proportion of wintering waterbird species meeting thresholds in the Celtic Seas has also declined sharply (53% in 2014/15) and has remained below target since 2006. GES for non-breeding (wintering) waterbirds has been achieved in the Greater North Sea but not in the Celtic Seas.\n\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-06-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/4c34f6bab3d47c6a3b25a1ef566bf4680ab80979","indicator":"3.3.1","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-01","graph_title":"Diverse seas: status of marine mammals and marine birds"},"3-2-1":{"indicator_reference":"C2","oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","oif_headline":"Not applicable","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","reporting_status":"Interim","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"bar","graph_stacked_disaggregation":true,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Disturbance","value":"Low disturbance (categories 0 to 4)"},{"field":"Disturbance","value":"High disturbance (categories 5 to 9)"}],"graph_title":"C2ii (interim), Predicated area of seabed in the UK Continental Shelf exposed to disturbance from bottom contact fishing by vessels over 12 m long and regional progress towards Good Environmental Status (GES) 2010 to 2015","computation_units":"Predicted area (% of total)","graph_annotations":[{"series":"","preset":"threshold_line_15"}],"graph_category_color":{"High disturbance (categories 5 to 9)":"#28779f","Low disturbance (categories 0 to 4)":"#008938"},"embedded_feature_layout":"single","embedded_feature_tab_title":"Map, C2i (interim)","embedded_feature_title":"C2i (interim), Predicted area of seabed in the UK Continental Shelf exposed to disturbance from bottom contact fishing vessels over 12 m long, 2010 to 2015","embedded_feature_html":"components/embedded-features/C2ai.html","embedded_feature_footer":"components/embedded-features/C2ai-footer.html","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Seabed subject to high pressure from human activity","national_geographical_coverage":"UK Continental Shelf","source_organisation_1":"Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)","source_url_1":"https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/biodiversity-status/habitats/extent-physical-damage-predominant-and-special-habitats/","oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Ensuring seafloor habitats are productive and sufficiently extensive to support healthy, sustainable ecosystems"],"oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_geographical_scope":"UK Continental Shelf","oif_readiness_data":"This indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form as some changes to the method are needed to include additional activities and improve habitat sensitivity assessment.

The annual values of the distribution and intensity of pressure are aggregated to give an average pressure intensity for reporting cycle. If the pressure intensity is highly variable across the 6-year period in an area the highest value is taken. Sensitivity and pressure are combined via a matrix, producing 10 categories of disturbance ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 9 (greatest disturbance possible).\n  \nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the physical damage to benthic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\nA lack of data relating to the activities of smaller fishing vessels (less than 12 m) exists as they are not equipped with a VMS recorder. Consequently, there is an underestimate of disturbance in inshore waters. Due to the analytical methods used there is a potential overestimate of disturbance as a consequence of assuming an even distribution of fishing pressures.\n\n## Trend description\n\nThere is currently no trend assessment due to the indicator not being considered previously. Changes over time might be identified by comparing results from multiple reporting cycle assessments such those produced by the UK Marine Strategy every 6 years. Future assessments will enable any trends to be identified, for example the number of regions achieving GES.\n\nThe results from 2010 to 2015 show pressure and disturbance caused by fishing activities to be widespread, occurring to some degree in 57% of the cells within UK waters. The charts show the aggregated values for seafloor disturbance from bottom fishing for the period 2010 to 2015. The highest level of disturbance is found in the English Channel and Southern Celtic Seas with 75% of both these areas being subject to high disturbance (categories 5 to 9). The extent of disturbance in the Northern North Sea and Southern North Sea is lower, 50% and 48% respectively, but still considerably above the target figure for GES. Within each assessment area there are grid cells showing no disturbance or low disturbance (categories 0 to 4), such as some central areas of the Northern North Sea. The Wider Atlantic (OSPAR Region V) was the only region to achieve GES over the assessment period 2010 to 2015 with 12% of its area subjected to high disturbance from bottom contact fishing.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9a6e71d38ab84cc2ba3404f22b44899e144e50eb","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9cfe1e37c04fb70c172a46238bf6aa88e4d729be","indicator":"3.2.1","target_id":"3.2","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-02-01"},"9-1-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"J1","oif_theme":"Resource Use and Waste","oif_headline":"Not applicable","reporting_status":"Interim","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"bar","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Carbon footprint and consumer buying choices","national_geographical_coverage":"England","computation_units":"Emissions (Mt CO2e)","graph_title":"J1 (interim), Consumption based greenhouse gas emissions in England, 2001 to 2017","graph_stacked_disaggregation":true,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Emissions type","value":"Direct household emissions of GHGs"},{"field":"Emissions type","value":"GHGs embedded in imported goods & services"},{"field":"Emissions type","value":"GHGs emitted from goods & services produced & consumed in England"}],"source_organisation_1":"Defra","source_url_1":"http://sciencesearch.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=20306&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=ev0279&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10%20-%20Description","oif_indicator_status":"Interim","oif_relevant_goal":["Mitigating and adapting to climate change","Minimising waste"],"oif_relevant_target":["Making sure that all policies, programmes and investment decisions take into account the possible extent of climate change this century","Working towards our ambition of zero avoidable waste by 2050"],"oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>None</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"England","data_footnote":"","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","page_content":"## Short description\n\nThis indicator tracks the carbon footprint of England\u2019s residents, by showing changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with final demand for goods and services in England, wherever the emissions arise across the globe.

Total consumption-based emissions have been on a downward trajectory since 2007: the greatest contribution to this trend has come from the goods and services produced in England and consumed here; and emissions embedded in imports have also reduced substantially (26.6% and 19.5% respectively from a 2007 peak overall). As a proportion of total emissions in 2017, GHGs emitted overseas in the production of goods and services consumed in England made up roughly half (46.3%) of the total footprint.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-21: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fd2ff5884b3c00f71b209820bdcc9381bd3683b3","indicator":"9.1.1","target_id":"9.1","sdg_goal":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-01-01"},"1-1-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"A1","indicator_name":"Emissions for five key air pollutants","graph_title":"A1, Emissions for five key air pollutants in England, 1998 to 2018","oif_theme":"Air","computation_units":"Index (1998 = 100)","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ricardo Energy and Environment","source_url_1":"https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1010#history","reporting_status":"Final","data_start_values":[{"field":"Pollutant","value":"NH3"},{"field":"Pollutant","value":"PM2.5"},{"field":"Pollutant","value":"NMVOC"},{"field":"Pollutant","value":"NOX"},{"field":"Pollutant","value":"SO2"}],"graph_annotations":[{"series":"","preset":"base_line"}],"graph_limits":[{"minimum":0,"maximum":110,"stepSize":10}],"published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","source_url_text_1":"Air Quality Pollutant Inventories 1990-2018","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","title":"Untitled","national_geographical_coverage":"England","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean air","Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Meeting legally binding targets to reduce emissions of five damaging air pollutants","Restoring 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their wildlife value for the long term"],"oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Emissions Reduction Commitments for the UK</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"England","oif_indicator_status":"Final","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","oif_headline":"Air quality","page_content":"## Short description\n\nThis indicator shows changes in the emissions of the 5 key air pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). Air pollution has negative impacts on human health and the environment. Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. As well as being emitted directly, particulate matter can be formed in the atmosphere from reactions between other pollutants, of which SO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, NMVOCs and NH<sub>3</sub> are the most important. NOx and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions can be deposited in soils or in rivers and lakes, for example, through rain. Resulting nutrient nitrogen deposition affects the nutrient levels and diversity of species in sensitive environments, for example, by encouraging algae growth in lakes and water courses and by producing ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) which damages crops and leads to impacts on wildlife through enhanced nutrient levels.\nThis indicator is an assessment of pressures on the atmosphere caused by the emissions of 5 key pollutants, which when concentrated in the air or deposited have impacts on human health and ecosystems.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are published annually in the [Air Quality Pollutant Inventories 1990-2018](https://naei.beis.gov.uk/reports/reports?report_id=1010).\n\n## Trend description\n\nEmissions for all 5 key air pollutants (ammonia, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide) in England have fallen over the latest 20 years for which annual, country-level data are available.

More recently, the trends in annual emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NMVOC have levelled off and emissions of NH<sub>3</sub> have increased. For PM<sub>2.5</sub>, decreases in emissions from many sources have been partially offset by increases in emissions from residential burning (domestic combustion); emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> from this source increased by 56% between 2007 and 2018.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-19: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/a569830354911cffe813fc32f9a2355021949306","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/87c20f160226fa012a07e539f0c6acbb9f9babe6","indicator":"1.1.1","target_id":"1.1","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-01-01"},"1-7-1":{"indicator_reference":"A7","oif_theme":"Air","oif_headline":"Not applicable","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","reporting_status":"Final","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"bar","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"UK Air Information Resource: Trends in critical load and critical level exceedances in the UK","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Area of land exposed to damaging levels of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) in the atmosphere","graph_title":"A7, Area of land in England exposed to damaging levels of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) in the atmosphere, 2009-11 to 2015-17","national_geographical_coverage":"England","computation_units":"Percentage of land area exceeding critical levels","source_organisation_1":"UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology","source_periodicity_1":"3-year moving average time periods","source_url_1":"https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/reports?report_id=1001","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean air","Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Meeting legally binding targets to reduce emissions of five damaging air pollutants","Restoring 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their wildlife value for the long term"],"oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n    <li>United Nations Economic Commission for Europe National Emissions Ceiling Directive Art.9 and the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution</li>\n    <li>Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 8</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"England","oif_indicator_status":"Final","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","data_footnote":"Data are presented as 3-year moving average time periods.","page_content":"## Short description\n\nThis indicator tracks changes in land area affected by damaging levels of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) in the air.

Waste crime is a broad term encompassing fly-tipping, illegal waste sites, illegal waste exports, the misdescription of waste and illegal waste dumping, among other illegal waste-related activities. If not handled properly, waste can cause serious pollution of the environment \u2013 air, land and water, which can also be harmful to health. It further reduces the availability of resources from waste. Current data reported include illegal waste sites and fly-tipping. The underpinning data can be used to establish the level of criminal activity for some aspects of waste crime and geographic distribution. Options for further development will be considered, including the impacts and behavioural aspects of waste crime, the amount and types of potential resources lost through waste crime, and to reflect the need for targeting and effective enforcement to deliver reductions in the level of criminal activities.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the number of: (a) illegal waste sites and (b) fly-tipping incidents in England. Some data on [illegal waste sites](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-2018-data-on-regulated-businesses-in-england) and [fly-tipping](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fly-tipping-in-england) are already published, but further work is required to develop the final indicator.\n\n## Note\n  \nConcerted sampling efforts from the Environment Agency to identify and investigate illegal waste sites resulted in a peak number being observed in 2011/12. In subsequent years, activity focused on interventions to disrupt and deal with offenders and close down illegal waste sites.\n  \n## Trend description\n\n**a) Illegal waste sites**\n\nThe total number of illegal waste sites in England fell from a peak of 1,011 active sites in the financial year 2011/12 to 556 active sites in 2013/14. Since then, the number has increased gradually, reaching 685 sites in 2018/19, before falling again to 544 sites in 2019/20. Within this total, the number of active high-risk illegal waste sites fell by 32.6% from a peak of 353 sites in 2012/13 to 238 sites in 2019/20. \n\n**b) Fly-tipping incidents**\n\nThe total number of fly-tipping incidents reported in England fell from 1.28 million incidents in the financial year 2007/08 to 715,000 incidents in 2012/13. Since these initial reductions, the number of incidents reported under the old methodology increased to over 1 million (1.07 million) between 2012/13 and 2018/19. The total number of fly-tipping incidents reported in 2018/19 under the new methodology was 957,000, 10.8% (115,000 incidents) lower than the total reported under the old methodology.

Fish are a good indicator of healthy freshwater environments, responding to changes in water quality (including temperature) and quantity, as well as the quality of river habitats, necessary to sustain healthy juvenile populations and enable migration throughout the rivers to complete their life cycles. Fish also provide an important recreational and economic benefit from freshwaters.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An updated interim indicator is presented here that expands on previous reporting to show (a) the proportion of principal salmon rivers at risk in England and, additionally, (b) the classification of fish species within English rivers. B7a shows annually published [national salmon stock data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonid-and-freshwater-fisheries-statistics-2019). For this assessment, each river\u2019s salmon stocks are placed into one of 4 categories: at risk; probably at risk; probably not at risk; and not at risk. The results act as a proxy for whether a particular river is at risk or not. In addition, a second measure of freshwater health has been included for the first time in 2021. [Fish classification data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4d28e5c2-dc05-4945-9574-002fa71db22f/wfd-cycle-2-overall-classification) for B7b reflect the status of fish species within rivers assessed in England. The results act as a proxy for whether the status of a particular river is: high; good; moderate; poor or bad. Further work will examine the coverage of the indicator.  \n\n## Trend description \n\n**a) Salmon stock status**\n\nThe percentage of principal salmon rivers at risk in England has risen by 10 percentage points, from 48% in 2004 to 58% in 2019; the percentage of rivers in the 'probably at risk' category has increased by 15 percentage points, from 21% to 36% over the same time period. The percentage of rivers in the 'not at risk' category has fallen by 24 percentage points to zero between 2004 and 2019, and while the percentage of rivers that are probably not at risk has fluctuated in the intervening years, it is the same in 2019 as it was in 2004. \n\n**b) Classification of fish**\n\nThe data show a slight but consistent increase in the numbers of rivers classed as high and good ecological status for fish between 2009 and 2015 and a corresponding small decrease in numbers of rivers in the poor and bad categories. Indications are that there was no change in the proportions of rivers in the 5 different categories between 2016 and 2019.\n\n\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/6f14a38f7f23d525c4e7acc2ee2f6632968a889f","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/482b2d9931f1ccee466a99f1def9175b047d6a6f","indicator":"2.7.1","target_id":"2.7","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-07-01","graph_title":"Health of freshwaters assessed through fish populations"},"2-2-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"B2","oif_theme":"Water","oif_headline":"Not applicable","reporting_status":"Final","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"bar","graph_stacked_disaggregation":true,"data_start_values":[{"field":"Category","value":"Category 1 (major) incidents"},{"field":"Category","value":"Category 2 (significant) incidents"}],"source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Serious pollution incidents to water","computation_units":"Number of incidents","source_organisation_1":"Environment Agency","source_url_1":"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-agency-2016-data-on-regulated-businesses-in-england","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean and plentiful water","Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["No specific target"],"oif_natural_capital":["Pressure on natural capital assets"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Domestically under the Environment Act 1995</li>\n  <li>Relevant under the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goal 6</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"England; data for individual incidents at any geographical scale are also available.","oif_indicator_status":"Final","data_footnote":"Only includes incidents where investigations and response have been completed by the Environment Agency.

Many SSSIs contain more than one geological heritage feature.\n\nMonuments designated as Scheduled Monuments have been recognised by the Secretary of State as being nationally important. For a monument to be considered of national importance its surviving features, above and/or below the surface of the land or sea bed, must have a particular significance that relates to its historic, traditional, architectural, artistic and/or archaeological interest. There are currently 19,848 Scheduled Monuments in England.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are available on [SSSI condition assessments](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx) (as a searchable database), and also as data download of SSSI Monitored features. Data on [Scheduled Monuments at risk](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage-at-risk/) are also available. These data have been collated over an extended time period. It is not currently possible to update them in full on a regular basis. A programme of work aimed at assessing the condition of as yet unassessed geological features and reassessing the condition of features which have not been assessed for more than 6 years, was initiated in 2020 and updated data will be reported on in 2022.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a) Condition of geological and geomorphological heritage features of Sites of Special Scientific Interest**\n\nIn total, 60% of all designated geological features have been assessed as in favourable condition. A further 8% have been assessed as unfavourable but recovering. Approximately 1% have been destroyed or partially destroyed.\n\n**b) Condition of Scheduled Monuments**\n\nIn total, 85% of all Scheduled Monuments are considered as being in optimal or generally satisfactory condition, whereas 13% are considered as either being in a generally unsatisfactory condition or having extensive significant problems.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fd6c7604c4881b77fb38fd8c504be1e74f0fa328","indicator":"7.2.1","target_id":"7.2","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-02-01","graph_title":"Condition of heritage features including designated geological sites and scheduled monuments"},"3-4-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"indicator_name":"Diverse seas: condition of seafloor habitats","indicator_reference":"C4","reporting_status":"Interim","embedded_feature_layout":"quartet","embedded_feature_tab_title":"Map, C4 (interim)","embedded_feature_title":"C4 (interim), Regional sea assessments, and the status of coastal water bodies and offshore units for 4 UK seafloor habitats, 2010 to 2015","embedded_feature_html":"components/embedded-features/C4a.html","embedded_feature_footer":"components/embedded-features/C4a-footer.html","oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","oif_headline":"Diversity of our seas","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","national_geographical_coverage":"UK","data_footnote":"","source_url_1":"https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/","oif_relevant_goal":["Thriving plants and wildlife"],"oif_relevant_target":["Reversing the loss of marine biodiversity and, where practicable, restoring it","Ensuring seafloor habitats are productive and sufficiently extensive to support healthy, sustainable ecosystems"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - seas"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goal 14</li><li>\tWater Framework Regulations \u2013 The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017, The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017, Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"UK","oif_indicator_status":"Interim","source_organisation_1":"Defra; Environment Agency; Joint Nature Conservation Committee; Natural Resources Wales; Scottish Environment Protection Agency","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","hide_chart":true,"hide_table":true,"page_content":"\n## Short description\n\nThis indicator of diverse seas evaluates the condition of seafloor habitats. Seafloor habitats assessed include soft sediment invertebrate communities and intertidal communities of seagrass, rocky shore macroalgae and saltmarshes. Once developed the indicator will assess the impact of human activities on seafloor habitats. \nData for the seafloor habitat condition indicators comes from surveys undertaken on a 6-yearly cycle using methods developed for Water Framework Directive classifications, now transposed to the Water Framework Regulations (WFR). These include the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae tool, intertidal seagrass tool, Infaunal Quality Index, and intertidal saltmarsh tool.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows target achievement for regional sea assessment, status of coastal water bodies and offshore unit assessments. The assessments used for this indicator have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) to assess progress towards the UK Marine Strategy target of achieving and maintaining Good Environmental Status (GES) in UK seas. Data on [benthic habitats](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/), analytical methods and assessment are available. Further methodological development of this indicator is required and the indicator\u2019s format will evolve.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the condition of benthic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a)\tSeagrass**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for intertidal seagrass communities\nwere met for all Regional Seas. Four Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an\nabsence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing\nWFD classification data. The natural conditions required for seagrass beds to exist limits\ntheir occurrence in coastal water bodies. However for those contributing, the quality\nthreshold of \u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018High\u2019 Ecological Status was met for the majority of surveyed\nlocations. The Irish Sea had the lowest extent of intertidal seagrass meeting the quality\ntarget, although the total remains markedly above the indicator quantity threshold of 85%.\n\n**b)\tRocky shore macroalgae**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae was met for all\nseven assessed Regional Seas. Two Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an\nabsence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing\nWFD classification data.\n\n**c)\tSaltmarsh**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for the saltmarsh communities was largely met for the\nCeltic Seas and Northern North Sea but was not met for considerable areas of the\nSouthern North Sea and the Eastern English Channel Regional Seas. Five Regional Seas\nwere not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the\nindicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data.\n\n**d)\tSoft sediment invertebrates**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for soft sediment (benthic) invertebrate communities was\nlargely met for most Regional Seas including the Minches and Western Scotland, Scottish\nContinental Shelf, Shared Waters between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland,\nNorthern North Sea and Eastern English Channel. The Western Channel and Celtic Sea\ndid not reach the target largely due to the inshore WFD classification results, while the\nfailure of the Southern North Sea to meet the target can be attributed to the offshore\nresults. The Irish Sea did not meet the target due to both inshore and offshore results. The\nAtlantic North-West Approaches was not assessed due to an absence of data.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9a6e71d38ab84cc2ba3404f22b44899e144e50eb","indicator":"3.4.1","target_id":"3.4","sdg_goal":"3","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-04-01","graph_title":"Diverse seas: condition of seafloor habitats"},"2-6-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"B6","oif_theme":"Water","oif_headline":"Not applicable","reporting_status":"In development","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Natural functions of water and wetland ecosystems","national_geographical_coverage":"England","oif_indicator_status":"In development","oif_relevant_goal":["Clean and plentiful water","Thriving plants and wildlife","Enhancing biosecurity"],"oif_relevant_target":["Creating or restoring 500,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitat outside the protected site network, focusing on priority habitats as part of a wider set of land management changes providing extensive benefits","Improving at least three-quarters of our waters to be close to their natural state","Reaching or exceeding objectives for rivers, lakes, coastal and ground waters that are specially protected, whether for biodiversity or drinking water as per our River Basin Management Plans","Restoring 75% of our one million hectares of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to favourable condition, securing their wildlife value for the long term"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - freshwater","Condition of assets - species and ecological communities"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended)</li>\n  <li>The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017</li>\n  <li>Domestic targets under England Biodiversity Strategy 2020</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"England.

Restoring natural functions to these ecosystems is essential for biodiversity recovery and resilience to climate change, and contributes to enhancing ecosystem services such as the provision of clean water and flood regulation. Indicator B6 is closely linked with indicator D1 on the extent, quality and connectivity of habitats as the naturalness of ecosystem function is also being considered within D1. It is anticipated that the development work on D1 and B6 will address different habitat components that are shared between the 2 indicators; B6 work will provide the freshwater habitat component and D1 will provide the wetland component.  \n\nThis indicator will help track improvements to the naturalness of underlying ecosystem functions in aquatic and wetland ecosystems. It will use data from a range of sources. Further development of methods and monitoring/evaluation frameworks will be needed to apply this approach to the full range of water and wetland habitat types and to explore new methods including Earth Observation.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021.

The WRMPs, prepared, published and maintained in accordance with provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991 and regulations and directions made under it, must set out how a company intends to maintain the balance between supply and demand for water over at least the next 25 years. This includes how it will manage the increasing pressures on our water supplies from a growing population and climate change, whilst protecting the environment. Water company drought plans, also prepared, published and maintained under Water Industry Act 1991, set out the operational actions the water companies will take before, during and after a drought to maintain a secure supply of water.\n\nThis indicator will track changes in a Supply Demand Balance Index (SDBI), which will be reported by all water and sewerage companies from Summer 2022.

We will therefore use the SDBI as the metric for this indicator and report on it from 2023.\n\nThe SDBI measures how a company is actually able to meet water demand compared to the design drought event that is set out in the company\u2019s Water Resources Management Plan (WRMP).

The assessment is based on (a) changes in lifeforms (groups of plankton species that perform the same function in the marine environment) that make up plankton communities, and (b) changes in the biomass of phytoplankton and the abundance of zooplankton. These assessments have been used to inform the assessment of GES for the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR). The changes experienced by plankton communities could have implications for the health (functioning, dynamics and structure) of the whole marine ecosystem.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form as existing analytical methods are under ongoing development to gain a better understanding of the effects of the key anthropogenic pressures and climatic drivers. Recent progress with this work is presented in a primary research article by [Bedford et al. (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.15066).The effects of these and future developments on this interim indicator will be considered as part of a wider review of the Outcome Indicator Framework. The assessments of [pelagic habitats](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/pelagic-habitats/) used for this interim indicator have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) and to fulfil reporting commitments under the [Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic](https://www.ospar.org/convention/text) (OSPAR).\n\n## Note\n\nNo data for this interim indicator are currently presented here, however spatial representations and charts for the underlying data can be accessed via the [Marine Online Assessment Tool](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/pelagic-habitats/). While the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the condition of pelagic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a)\tChanges in plankton communities, 2004-2008 to 2009-2014**\n\nThe lifeforms (functional groups of species) that make up the plankton communities in the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea changed between the starting conditions period (2004 to 2008) and the current assessment period (2009 to 2014). Prevailing environmental conditions, in particular, climate change, are likely to be driving these observed changes, but the potential role of direct human activities such as fishing and nutrient inputs contributing to these changes cannot be ruled out. It is currently uncertain whether GES has been achieved.\n\n**b)\tChanges in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance, 2004-2008 to 2009-2014**\n\nIn most areas of the Celtic Seas and the Greater North Sea, phytoplankton biomass has increased between the starting conditions period (2004 to 2008) and the current assessment period (2009 to 2014). Changes in zooplankton abundance varied across the 2 sub-regions assessed, with increases in some areas, decreases in others, and no change in some. This assessment identified, with a medium to high level of confidence, changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance which may have consequences on the functioning, dynamics and structure of the whole marine ecosystem. It is not yet possible to say if GES has been achieved.\n\n\n\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"3.5.1","target_id":"3.5","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-05-01","graph_title":"Diverse seas: condition of pelagic habitats"},"10-3-1":{"goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","indicator_reference":"K3","oif_theme":"International","oif_headline":"Impacts on the natural environment overseas","reporting_status":"In development","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Link to source","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","oif_relevant_target":["None"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - species and ecological communities"],"oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 12</li>\n  <li>Sustainable Development Goals 14 and 15</li>\n</ul>","oif_geographical_scope":"UK Overseas Territories","national_geographical_coverage":"UK Overseas Territories","indicator_name":"Status of endemic and globally threatened species in the UK Overseas Territories","oif_indicator_status":"In development","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","oif_relevant_goal":["There are no specific goals in the 25 Year Environment Plan for this indicator, but the Plan commits us to taking action to recover threatened, iconic or economically important species of animals, plants and fungi, and where possible to prevent human-induced extinction or loss of known threatened species, in the Overseas Territories."],"page_content":"## Short description\n\nUK Overseas Territories are home to rich, globally important biodiversity, with many species found nowhere else in the world.

These standards aim to green our towns and cities, by improving existing green infrastructure provision and encouraging more investment. The Standards will guide stakeholders to focus on areas where we know that there is not enough accessible green infrastructure, or that what is there is of poor quality. The Standards will also guide the inclusion of accessible green space in new developments and advise the improvement of any area with little or no green space for the benefit of the community. Green and blue infrastructure can also make an important contribution towards adaptation to climate change.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021. However, Natural England and Defra have updated the [Accessible Natural Greenspace Standards](http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/65021) (draft) to inform the development of indicators for accessible greenspace quantity and proximity, at different scales. Further work in 2021 is planned to explore potential indicators of Green Infrastructure (GI) quality based on the attributes of GI. Natural England and Defra have also developed initial draft baseline maps of Green and Blue Infrastructure across England, for analysis using the updated Accessible Natural Greenspace Standards and other standards and indicators in development. The draft maps were trialled in areas across England from December 2020 to February 2021 and will be refined for reporting.\n\nInformation on changes in the public\u2019s perceptions of green and blue space quality and access to green and blue spaces is now gathered by Natural England using the People and Nature Survey for England.

Data are currently available for specific chemicals in birds of prey, water, fish, mammals, and shellfish. Other exposure data for chemicals will be incorporated should they become available in the future. The indicator will also be developed to consider the adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife populations and individuals.\n\nThis indicator is complementary to other indicators within the framework that give data on environmental pressures from chemicals, for example \u2018B1 Pollution loads entering waters\u2019 and \u2018H3 Emissions of mercury and persistent organic pollutants to the environment\u2019.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here as an Experimental Statistic that covers the exposure of wildlife to chemicals in the environment and, where feasible, the risk from different types of chemicals to wildlife on land and in water. The indicator is based on chemical \nconcentrations found in water and in different organisms \u2013 sparrowhawk/red kite, red fox (data extraction under development), freshwater fish, otter, blue mussel, dab, and harbour porpoise. It covers 3 environmental compartments: terrestrial, freshwater and marine (estuarine, coastal and offshore) The chemicals are representative of 3 groups highlighted for attention under the 25 Year Environment Plan: persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances, heavy metals, and pesticides and biocides.\n\nThese data are being published as an Experimental Statistic in order to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator. We would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk). Further details on the indicator development and data analysis used are given in the supporting [H4 indicator report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/exposure-and-adverse-effects-of-chemicals-on-wildlife-in-the-environment-interim-h4-indicator). Some data relevant to this indicator are published: [Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme \u2013 contaminant exposure](https://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/content/chemicals-monitored), [Water Quality Data Archive](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/landing), [British Oceanographic Data Centre \u2013 Monitoring and Assessment National database (MERMAN)](https://www.bodc.ac.uk/projects/data_management/uk/merman/).\n\nA trial of this interim indicator was independently reviewed in 2020. We will continue to work with partners through 2021 to improve our reporting based on recommendations and our findings. We will seek to address data gaps for all substances to get a fuller picture across compartments and improve our ability to report exposure trends. Future work will also consider methods for reporting the effects on wildlife of chemicals in the environment.\n\n## Note\n\nAvailable thresholds for wildlife have been used to provide context to the most-recent national concentrations; their use to indicate risk does not represent a compliance assessment and should not be compared with other regulatory reporting regimes which may use values with different protection goals. The approach for deriving thresholds is specific to the wildlife or environmental medium being considered because of the data available and the purpose for which it was gathered. Monitoring networks and thresholds can change over time.\n\nThe freshwater risk assessment for pesticides is currently based on a threshold for short-term toxic effects. In the future, a long-term threshold will be used to reflect risks from chronic exposure.\n\nAdditional data are available for otter, freshwater fish and red fox which cannot be incorporated into the dashboard at present, but are provided in the supporting report to this indicator. The report also contains information on spatial variation in results for freshwater metals sites and for marine fish.  \n  \n## Trend description\n\n**PBT substances**\n\nDownward trends are observed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in marine fish (dab) and for PBDEs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid in harbour porpoise. These trends are particularly evident for PBDEs.\n\nExceedance of thresholds is most significant for mercury in the freshwater and marine environments, followed by PCBs in the marine environment. The result for mercury in dab may be over-precautionary for reasons given in the supporting report.\n\n**Heavy metals**\n\nFor heavy metals, downward trends are observed for nickel and zinc in sparrowhawks, although the data are only available up to 2014. There is an upward trend for nickel in dab, \nwhich is driven by eastern and southern coastal marine sites.\n\nThe exceedance of the nickel threshold in estuarine and coastal waters is only driven by one site. Zinc shows the highest rate of threshold exceedance of the metals in both freshwater and estuarine and coastal waters.\n\nWhile the freshwater data for heavy metals show no change in concentrations from 2014 to 2019, these results can be split into 2 types: those for sites where the waters are affected by abandoned metal mines and those for sites in other locations. Cadmium and copper exhibit downward trends for the \u2018other\u2019 sites over the assessed time period. For waters affected by abandoned metal mines, their elevated levels of metals mean that they comprise a high proportion of those sites above available thresholds, except for nickel \nwhere sites in other locations comprise the majority of those at risk.\n\n**Pesticides and biocides**\n\nIt is not possible to assess trends currently for pesticides and second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs). Risk is indicated for less than a quarter of sites or \nindividuals considered for pesticides in water and SGARs in red kite.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9a6e71d38ab84cc2ba3404f22b44899e144e50eb","indicator":"8.4.1","target_id":"8.4","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-04-01","graph_title":"Exposure and adverse effects of chemicals on wildlife in the environment"},"3-11-1":{"indicator_reference":"C11","goal_meta_link_text":"UN metadata","reporting_status":"In development","data_non_statistical":false,"data_show_map":false,"graph_type":"line","source_active_1":true,"source_url_text_1":"Sensitive fish species","source_active_2":false,"source_url_text_2":"Link to Source","source_active_3":false,"source_url_3":"Link to source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to source","source_active_6":false,"source_url_text_6":"Link to source","published":false,"title":"Untitled","indicator_name":"Productive seas: status of sensitive fish and shellfish stocks","oif_theme":"Seas and Estuaries","oif_headline":"Not applicable","national_indicator_available":null,"national_geographical_coverage":"UK","source_url_1":"https://oap.ospar.org/en/ospar-assessments/intermediate-assessment-2017/biodiversity-status/fish-and-food-webs/recovery-sensitive-fish/","oif_relevant_goal":["Using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently"],"oif_relevant_target":["Ensuring that all fish stocks are recovered to and maintained at levels that can produce their maximum sustainable yield"],"oif_natural_capital":["Condition of assets - seas"],"oif_geographical_scope":"UK","oif_indicator_status":"In development","oif_commitments":"<ul>\n  <li>Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)</li>\n  <li>UK Marine Strategy (Marine Strategy Regulations 2010)</li>\n  <li>Convention on Biological Diversity Aichi Target 6</li>\n  <li>Relevant to Sustainable Development Goals 12 and 14</li>\n</ul>","oif_date_last_updated":"11 June 2021","page_content":"## Short Description\n\nThis indicator will track changes in the abundance, distribution and condition of fish and shellfish species at risk of depletion.

It consists of 2 metrics. The first metric looks at the size of the fish in a community (Typical Length) and the second looks at the composition of fish communities (Mean Maximum Length). Together these metrics tell us about the health and status of fish communities. A healthy fish community will be made up of species in the expected ratio of numbers of individuals, and with individual species showing the age classes and sizes consistent with a healthy population. Typical Length: a reduction in the proportion of larger, older, fish (as measured by Typical Length) of several species, suggests the top (predator) level of the food web is in poor condition. Mean Maximum Length: if the species that tend towards larger individuals are depleted and smaller-bodied species become more abundant (shown by a reduction in Mean Maximum Length), the species composition of the community can change, suggesting prolonged periods of pressure. When the community is dominated by slow growing species (as expected at low Maximum Mean Length), the size structure is limited in its ability to recover (reduced Typical Length).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in a finalised form. Further development of this indicator is required to include trophic guild biomass and therefore improve community classification. An interim indicator is presented here with communities classified as demersal or pelagic. The assessments used for this interim indicator have been reported under the UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019). Data on [fish populations](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/fish/), analytical methods and assessment are available.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of fish and shellfish populations. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a) Typical Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities**\n\nIn the Channel, northern North Sea and the eastern Irish Sea, the health of the demersal fish community has improved since the 1990s, with an increasing contribution of species that attain a large size (Typical Length). In the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the balance of species within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller bodied fish (low Typical Length) indicating this community is in poorer health. In the northern North Sea no change in the Typical Length in the pelagic fish community is evident. The Typical Length of pelagic fish generally shows no long-term change at the sub-regional level in the Celtic Seas.\n\n**b) Mean Maximum Length of demersal and pelagic fish communities**\n\nIn the central and southern North Sea and on the shelf edge to the west of Scotland, the balance of species within demersal communities, relative to the early 1980s, has shifted towards smaller species (low Mean Maximum Length), indicating this community is in poorer health. There has been no long-term change in Mean Maximum Length of demersal fish communities in the northern North Sea. Within the southern and central North Sea, the Mean Maximum Length of pelagic fish communities is declining suggesting the proportion of large or slow growing species is declining. There is no long-term change in the Mean Maximum Length in the northern North Sea.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9a6e71d38ab84cc2ba3404f22b44899e144e50eb","indicator":"3.7.1","target_id":"3.7","sdg_goal":"3","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-01","graph_title":"Healthy seas: fish and shellfish populations"}}
