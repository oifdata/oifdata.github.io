It is based on the ratio of inputs (indicator \u2018E3 Volume of inputs used in agricultural production\u2019) to outputs (indicator \u2018E2 Volume of agricultural production\u2019) such that the higher the value, the more efficiently inputs are converted into outputs. Data are based on volumes rather than values so that price effects are removed. The measure is known as Total Factor Productivity as it takes into account all output and input factors, including land, labour, intermediate consumption and depreciation of capital.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the total factor productivity for the UK. Data on [total factor productivity for England by farm type](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-for-england-by-farm-type) are published as experimental statistics, but the National Statistics publication on [total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/total-factor-productivity-of-the-agricultural-industry) is considered to be a more reliable source for this indicator until the England-level data receive accreditation as National Statistics.\n\n## Trend description for Figure E4\n\nOverall productivity is driven by both the output and input components. Total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK was 54% higher in 2020 than it was in 1973. There has been an overall long-term increase driven by both increased outputs and a fall in inputs, although the separate trends (see indicators E2 and E3) have followed different patterns. There is considerable annual variation, this variation being mainly driven by variation in output volumes, and over the most recent year (2020), total factor productivity of the agricultural industry in the UK fell by 4.5%.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change in efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity has been observed over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2014 to 2019). This is in contrast to increasing trends in the medium and long term. It is not possible to simplistically categorise any change as either an \u2018improvement\u2019 or \u2018deterioration\u2019 for the environment as this will depend on the farming practices driving change.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been little or no change in efficiency of agricultural production measured by Total Factor Productivity since 2018, based on 3 years of data. We set a minimum of 5 data points for the production of a robust trend for this assessment so this result should be treated with caution until the next iteration is available.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table E4: Assessment of change in the efficiency of agricultural production in the UK measured by Total Factor Productivity\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2014-2019 | +1.9 (smoothed Loess) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2009-2019 | +4.8 (smoothed Loess) | Change (increasing) |\n| Long term | 1973-2019 | +57.2 (smoothed Loess) | Change (increasing) |\n\nNote that assessment categories were assigned based on smoothed data, so percent change figures in Table E4 may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere. It is not possible to define a simplistic desired direction of change for this indicator so cannot assign \u2018improvement\u2019 or \u2018deterioration\u2019.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-10","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-08-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/7ba21291aafda3353dd8a65d3190d312fbf177bd","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-08-10: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/7ba21291aafda3353dd8a65d3190d312fbf177bd","indicator":"5.4.1","target_id":"5.4","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-04-01"}
