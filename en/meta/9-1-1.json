The indicator will show how consumer preferences and behaviour are impacting on the overall national carbon footprint.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows consumption-based GHG emissions in England. Data underpinning this metric are available in [Material footprint and resource efficiency in the UK](http://sciencesearch.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=20306&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=ev0279&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10%20-%20Description), These source data are currently published as Experimental Statistics whilst there are ongoing refinements to the methodology.\n\nData at a UK level are published as [UK\u2019s carbon footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint). Further data may be available in the future tracking an index of carbon emissions impacts due to consumer buying choices.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of consumption-based GHG emissions in England. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description\n\nEngland\u2019s carbon footprint (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) was estimated to be equivalent to 652.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e) in 2017, a 15.3% reduction on levels in 2001 (770.5 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e). GHGs emitted directly by households (making up 18.8% of the footprint in 2017) were 11.1% lower in 2017 than in 2001 as a result of reductions in emissions associated with household-related heating. Total consumption-based emissions have been on a downward trajectory since 2007: the greatest contribution to this trend has come from the goods and services produced in England and consumed here; and emissions embedded in imports have also reduced substantially (26.6% and 19.5% respectively from a 2007 peak overall). As a proportion of total emissions in 2017, GHGs emitted overseas in the production of goods and services consumed in England made up roughly half (46.3%) of the total footprint.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-21: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fd2ff5884b3c00f71b209820bdcc9381bd3683b3","indicator":"9.1.1","target_id":"9.1","sdg_goal":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-01-01"}
