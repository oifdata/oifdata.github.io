Chemical reactions in the air involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produce the toxic gas O<sub>3</sub> which can harm health, damage wild plants, crops, forests and some materials, and is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as a pressure on human health and thriving plants and wildlife. It is determined by calculating the annual average of the maximum daily 8-hour mean concentrations of O<sub>3</sub> measured at all rural measurement sites on Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published annually as [National Statistics, Air Quality Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/air-quality-statistics).\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe average daily maximum 8 hour mean concentration of ozone has fluctuated since the beginning of the time series in 1987. It was 72 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup> in 2019; a 28% increase in concentration compared to 1987 but a slight decrease in concentration compared to 2018 (74 \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>). Some variance from year to year is expected due to fluctuations in the occurrence of hot summer weather conditions which are associated with high ozone concentrations.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9de3f98383bf3f71f3c178c162bf9f000102bf37","indicator":"1.4.1","target_id":"1.4","sdg_goal":"1","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"01-04-01"}
