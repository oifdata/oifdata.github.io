It is a measure of the level of active management of woodland assets for economic productive purposes. The data are National Statistics from Forest Research on UK Wood Production and Trade.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData on the volume of timber brought to market from English sources are published annually in the [Forestry Commission\u2019s Key Performance Indicators Reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators).\n\n## Trend description for Figure E6\n\nThe total annual volume of softwood and hardwood timber brought to market in England has increased from 2.3 million green tonnes in 2010 to 2.8 million green tonnes in 2020. Total removals from the nation\u2019s forests managed by Forestry England have fallen by 9% over this period, whereas removals from other English sources have increased by 59%.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the total volume of timber brought to market per annum from English sources (softwood and hardwood combined) over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2015 to 2020). There has been a decrease (or deterioration) over the medium term (2010 to 2020). The time series is not yet sufficient to make an assessment for a long-term period.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. There has been a decrease (or deterioration) in percentage of the annual growth harvested since 2018. However, this is based on only 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table E6: Assessment of change in the volume of timber brought to market from English sources\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2015-2020 | +9.4 (unsmoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | 2010-2020 | +22.8 (unsmoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Long term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n\nPercent change refers to the difference seen from the first to last year in the specified date range.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-01-13","national_data_updated_date":"2023-01-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-01-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/502dedeab89faeb5dda33813db8d7cbbb0d4e1cb","national_data_update_url_text":"2023-01-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/502dedeab89faeb5dda33813db8d7cbbb0d4e1cb","indicator":"5.6.1","target_id":"5.6","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-06-01"}
