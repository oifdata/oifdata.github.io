The indicator will have 2 components: (a) changes in the relative abundance of those widespread species for which relevant data are available; and (b) changes in the distribution (the number of 1km grid squares in which species are recorded in any given year) of widespread species for which relevant data are available.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows trends in the abundance of (a) breeding wild birds, (b) widespread butterflies and (c) widespread bats in England. The expectation is that this indicator will be expanded to include more species groups and habitat types in the future. Some data are already published annually elsewhere ([wild birds](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/wild-bird-populations-in-england), [butterflies on farmland and in woodland, and bats](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators)), and methods for analysing trends in plants are being developed. Further work is required to combine and present trends for different species groups and habitat types within the abundance and distribution measures in this indicator.\n\n## Note on Figures D4ai, D4aii, D4bi, D4bii and D4c\n\nDue to COVID-19 restrictions in England, the latest Breeding Bird Survey report prepared by the British Trust for Ornithology, the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee collected limited data in 2020 and therefore it was not possible to update the indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England either here or in the source publication.\n\n## Trend description for Figures D4ai, D4aii, D4bi, D4bii and D4c\n\nWhilst the following overall trends are clear from the charts, they mask the trends for individual species within each index \u2013 some farmland and woodland species trends have increased whereas others have either remained the same or decreased over time. Further details on these individual species trends are available in the source publications.\n\n### D4a) Breeding wild birds\n\nThe indicators for breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland in England have both declined between 1970 and 2019; the former by almost 30%, the latter by 60%. Farmland birds experienced steeper declines during the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s because of rapid changes in farmland management.\n\n### D4b) Widespread butterflies\n\nThe indicators for widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland in England also declined between 1990 and 2010, the former more steeply than the latter. However, in recent years, the woodland butterfly indicator has shown little change while the farmland butterfly indicator has increased to a figure similar to its 1990 baseline value.\n\n### D4c) Widespread bats\n\nThe indicator for widespread bats in England has increased by approximately 40% since the turn of the century. The bat species within this index vary in their habitat requirements, but all occur in farmland and woodland landscapes.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nIndicators for breeding wild birds, widespread butterflies and widespread bats in England are also reported in the [England Biodiversity Indicators](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators), which presents a short and long-term assessment for the same time periods used in this Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. These assessment results were reused as the England Biodiversity Indicators method is tailored to the datasets of the specific taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies and bats) and factors-in information on confidence. The assessment found a decrease (or deterioration) in both breeding wild birds on farmland and woodland in England over the short term (the most recent 5 years for which data were available). There was little or no change in widespread butterflies in woodland and on farmland over this period, and an increase (or improvement) in widespread bats. Over the long term, decreases in breeding wild birds in woodland and on farmland, and widespread butterflies in woodland, were recorded. Widespread butterflies on farmland showed little or no change in the long term, while widespread bats increased.\n\nChange since 2018 has also been assessed. An assessment using the England Biodiversity Indicators methodology was only available for butterflies for this time period. Little or no change was seen since 2018 for both widespread woodland and farmland butterflies. However, this is based on 3 data points so should be considered as indicative and not evidence of a clear trend.\n\nDetails on the England Biodiversity Indicators assessment method can be found in sections 5 and 6 of the latest [England Biodiversity Indicators report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Further information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n### Table D4ai: Assessment of change in the abundance of breeding wild birds in woodland in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -6.0 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1970-2018 | -27.6 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table D4aii: Assessment of change in the abundance of breeding wild birds on farmland in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2013-2018 | -6.4 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1970-2018 | -59.0 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table D4bi: Assessment of change in the abundance of widespread butterflies in woodland in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2015-2020 | + 10.4 (smoothed data) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2010-2020 | +12.0 (smoothed data) | Little or no change |\n| Long term | 1990-2020 | - 41.1 (smoothed data) | Deterioration |\n\n### Table D4bii: Assessment of change in the abundance of widespread butterflies on farmland in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2015-2020 | +10.2 (smoothed data) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2010-2020 | +16.0 (smoothed data) | Little or no change |\n| Long term | 1990-2020 | -8.3 (smoothed data) | Little or no change |\n\n### Table D4c: Assessment of change in the abundance of widespread bats in England\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2014-2019 | +9.1 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n| Medium term | N/A | N/A | Not assessed |\n| Long term | 1999-2019 | +43.9 (smoothed data) | Improvement |\n\nNote that smoothed data presented in Figures D4ai to D4c were used for percent change calculations. The smoothing method is specific to this indicator and differs from the default Loess smoothing approach adopted for most indicators for the Outcome Indicator Framework assessment. Percent change figures in Tables D4ai to D4c may differ from unsmoothed values quoted elsewhere. Percent change refers to the difference seen between the first and last years in the specified date range.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-08-05","national_data_updated_date":"2022-08-05","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-08-05: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/568804991dfc7a4a3e8f9040dfbd4e8a6d911e63","national_data_update_url_text":"2022-08-05: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/568804991dfc7a4a3e8f9040dfbd4e8a6d911e63","indicator":"4.4.1","target_id":"4.4","sdg_goal":"4","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"04-04-01","graph_title":"Relative abundance and/or distribution of widespread species"}
