Seafloor habitats assessed include soft sediment invertebrate communities and intertidal communities of seagrass, rocky shore macroalgae and saltmarshes. Once developed the indicator will assess the impact of human activities on seafloor habitats. \nData for the seafloor habitat condition indicators comes from surveys undertaken on a 6-yearly cycle using methods developed for Water Framework Directive classifications, now transposed to the Water Framework Regulations (WFR). These include the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae tool, intertidal seagrass tool, Infaunal Quality Index, and intertidal saltmarsh tool.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows target achievement for regional sea assessment, status of coastal water bodies and offshore unit assessments. The assessments used for this indicator have been reported under the updated UK Marine Strategy Part One (2019) to assess progress towards the UK Marine Strategy target of achieving and maintaining Good Environmental Status (GES) in UK seas. Data on [benthic habitats](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/benthic-habitats/), analytical methods and assessment are available. Further methodological development of this indicator is required and the indicator\u2019s format will evolve.\n\n## Note\n\nWhile the currently available data predate the 25 Year Environment Plan, they provide the most recently available assessment of the condition of benthic habitats. They enable a better understanding of a baseline from which to measure progress towards the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan when the indicator is next updated.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a)\tSeagrass**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for intertidal seagrass communities\nwere met for all Regional Seas. Four Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an\nabsence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing\nWFD classification data. The natural conditions required for seagrass beds to exist limits\ntheir occurrence in coastal water bodies. However for those contributing, the quality\nthreshold of \u2018Good\u2019 or \u2018High\u2019 Ecological Status was met for the majority of surveyed\nlocations. The Irish Sea had the lowest extent of intertidal seagrass meeting the quality\ntarget, although the total remains markedly above the indicator quantity threshold of 85%.\n\n**b)\tRocky shore macroalgae**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for the intertidal rocky shore macroalgae was met for all\nseven assessed Regional Seas. Two Regional Seas were not assessed due to either an\nabsence of intertidal habitat which is required by the indicator or an absence of existing\nWFD classification data.\n\n**c)\tSaltmarsh**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for the saltmarsh communities was largely met for the\nCeltic Seas and Northern North Sea but was not met for considerable areas of the\nSouthern North Sea and the Eastern English Channel Regional Seas. Five Regional Seas\nwere not assessed due to either an absence of intertidal habitat which is required by the\nindicator or an absence of existing WFD classification data.\n\n**d)\tSoft sediment invertebrates**\n\nThe UK Marine Strategy target for soft sediment (benthic) invertebrate communities was\nlargely met for most Regional Seas including the Minches and Western Scotland, Scottish\nContinental Shelf, Shared Waters between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland,\nNorthern North Sea and Eastern English Channel. The Western Channel and Celtic Sea\ndid not reach the target largely due to the inshore WFD classification results, while the\nfailure of the Southern North Sea to meet the target can be attributed to the offshore\nresults. The Irish Sea did not meet the target due to both inshore and offshore results. The\nAtlantic North-West Approaches was not assessed due to an absence of data.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-08-04: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/9a6e71d38ab84cc2ba3404f22b44899e144e50eb","indicator":"3.4.1","target_id":"3.4","sdg_goal":"3","graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-04-01","graph_title":"Diverse seas: condition of seafloor habitats"}
