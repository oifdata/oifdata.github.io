Ambitious reductions in water consumption and leakage have a significant role in maintaining secure supplies and protecting the environment. This indicator shows changes in the efficient use of water, focussing on (a) leakage and (b) per capita consumption. Leakage and per capita household consumption of water in England are existing metrics reported to The Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and the Environment Agency. \n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nWater companies [report leakage and per capita consumption figures](https://www.discoverwater.co.uk/) annually. From 2020, water companies report their leakage performance against Ofwat\u2019s 2025 target, this is a 3-year average with 2017/2018 as a start point for the 3-year average.\n\n## Trend description \n\n**a)\tWater leakage**\n\nBetween 2017/18 and 2019/20, total water leakage in England averaged 2,897 megalitres per day, 8% lower than the daily average for the 3 years from 2000/01 to 2002/03. \n\n**b)\tPer capita water consumption**\n\nPer capita water consumption has also fallen during the time period covered by this indicator, from an average of 152 litres per person per day in the 3 years to 2003/04 to an average of 141 litres per person per day in the most recent 3-year time period (2017/18 to 2019/20).\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/37d85c0ae8ad96633a6565bfe0938b8f772916c0","indicator":"5.8.1","target_id":"5.8","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-08-01","graph_title":"Efficient use of water"}
