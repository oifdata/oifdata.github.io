More work is being done to define exactly what the indicator will include but it could include physical properties (such as a measure of soil structure), chemical properties (such as soil carbon, nutrients and pH), bare ground / soil and a measure of soil biological activity. This indicator is not limited to agricultural soils. Further development of statistically and scientifically robust national monitoring programmes may be needed to provide data for this indicator.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 as significant further development work is required. Some data on aspects of [soil health](https://countrysidesurvey.org.uk/content/soils-report-2007) are already published but they do not provide a full baseline.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"5.7.1","target_id":"5.7","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-07-01"}
