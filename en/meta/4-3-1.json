Woodland as defined for the National Forest Inventory is land under stands of trees with a minimum area of 0.5 hectares, a width of at least 20 metres, and a canopy cover of at least 20% or having the potential to achieve this. The definition relates to land use, rather than land cover, so integral open space and areas of felled trees that are awaiting restocking (replanting) are included as woodland. Woodland is a key natural capital asset that provides many natural capital benefits, such as the provision of timber and other wood products, carbon storage, habitats for wildlife, and opportunities for exercise and recreation.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nUpdates are published annually in [Forestry Statistics](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/statistics/forestry-statistics/) (Forest Research), with additional commentary on recent trends and new planting of trees in the quarterly [Headline Key Performance Indicators reports](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/forestry-commission-corporate-plan-performance-indicators) (Forestry Commission).\n\n## Trend description\n\nThe total area of woodland in England has increased from 1.24 million hectares in 1998 to 1.31 million hectares in 2020, equating to an increase from 9.5% to 10.05% of the land area of England. This growth has been driven by an increase in broadleaf woodland; the area of conifer woodland in England has remained relatively static over the last 20 years.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/562688359a3d4a20fb36002404e1856e2f07c446","indicator":"4.3.1","target_id":"4.3","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-03-01"}
