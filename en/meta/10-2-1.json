Climate change and the deterioration of natural environments are prime drivers of poverty, food insecurity and instability, and can trigger conflict and migration. This indicator will report outcomes of UK investment programmes (such as International Climate Finance, the Darwin Initiative and the Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund) that support developing countries to protect and improve the environment, address illegal wildlife trade, mitigate and adapt to climate change and alleviate poverty.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021. Further development is needed to identify how to assess outcomes of UK overseas investment building on existing evaluation schemes for [International Climate Finance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance), [The Darwin Initiative](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/the-darwin-initiative), and the [Illegal Wildlife Trade Challenge Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/illegal-wildlife-trade-iwt-challenge-fund).\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"10.2.1","target_id":"10.2","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-02-01","graph_title":"Developing countries better able to protect and improve the environment with UK support"}
