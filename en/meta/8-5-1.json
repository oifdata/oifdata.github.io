It does not include neighbour and neighbourhood noise. The indicator will show the estimated number of people exposed to noise levels (in 5 decibel bands) from the most significant road, rail and air sources. Health costs (and hence burden to the economy) of noise can be estimated from health outcomes associated with noise exposure (such as annoyance, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular effects). The available data being explored for this indicator\u2019s development are currently derived through strategic noise mapping undertaken at 5-year intervals.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 as the model for producing this data is in development. Prototype development began in 2021, focussing initially on a small-scale geographical pilot to refine technical approach before subsequent expansion to full-scale national level modelling. Data for [noise exposure](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/strategic-noise-mapping-2019) is published.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as it is still in development.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-09-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-09-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/e984835fe3a855464af3cef2f104efd46ca05a64","indicator":"8.5.1","target_id":"8.5","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-05-01","graph_title":"Exposure to transport noise"}
