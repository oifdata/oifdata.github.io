Long-term exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and lung cancer. The main sources of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution are industrial processes, combustion in residential, public, commercial and agricultural sectors and road transport.\n\nThis indicator is an assessment of clean air (reporting the condition of the atmosphere as an asset). It can also be considered as pressure on human health. It is determined by calculating the annual population-weighted mean concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the air, assessed as background concentrations per 1 km square. The population-weighted mean concentration is used as a measure of the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> on the health of the total population. Greater weighting is given to concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in urban areas to reflect the higher population density as those concentrations will affect a greater number of people. In addition, people living in urban areas are generally exposed to greater levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> than those living in rural areas.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are already published annually at [UK Air Information Resource, Modelled background pollution data](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/pcm-data).\n\n## Note\n\nPM<sub>2.5</sub> annual mean concentrations are estimated annually for every square kilometre of the UK through the Pollution Climate Mapping (PCM) model. The geographical distribution of the UK population is then joined to the estimated concentrations to estimate the annual mean concentration of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, weighted on where the population lives. This enables us to account for the majority of the population living in densely populated urban areas, where concentrations are likely to be greatest.\n\n## Trend description\n\nPopulation-weighted annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in England have declined from 12.1 ug/m<sup>3</sup> in 2011 to 9.6 ug/m<sup>3</sup> in 2019, a fall of 21% over the latest 8 years for which data are available.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-22: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/5611d94ed68821ddc50bc899b04bf5f9b320e5b8","indicator":"1.3.1","target_id":"1.3","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-03-01"}
