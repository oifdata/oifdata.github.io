Restoring natural functions to these ecosystems is essential for biodiversity recovery and resilience to climate change, and contributes to enhancing ecosystem services such as the provision of clean water and flood regulation. Indicator B6 is closely linked with indicator D1 on the extent, quality and connectivity of habitats as the naturalness of ecosystem function is also being considered within D1. It is anticipated that the development work on D1 and B6 will address different habitat components that are shared between the 2 indicators; B6 work will provide the freshwater habitat component and D1 will provide the wetland component.  \n\nThis indicator will help track improvements to the naturalness of underlying ecosystem functions in aquatic and wetland ecosystems. It will use data from a range of sources. Further development of methods and monitoring/evaluation frameworks will be needed to apply this approach to the full range of water and wetland habitat types and to explore new methods including Earth Observation.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021. Substantial progress has continued to been made since 2020, building on the foundation provided by [Natural England Report JP016](http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/4635950369472512), on determining attributes for rivers and streams, developing a draft framework for high-level reporting of the indicator, designing a working model of the rivers\u2019 component and rationalising the broad relationship with Outcome Indicator D1 \u2018Quantity, quality and connectivity of habitats\u2019. New monitoring frameworks are being designed to provide data for the B6 indicator, particularly in respect of headwater streams and smaller lakes. Further development in 2021 will focus on the lakes and ponds components and refining the overarching model for the indicator.\n\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"2.6.1","target_id":"2.6","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-06-01","graph_title":"Natural functions of water and wetland ecosystems"}
