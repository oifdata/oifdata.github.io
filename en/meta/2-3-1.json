The indicator is composed of several metrics including: percentage of water tests meeting good (or better) Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 (the WFD regulations) status for ecology and chemistry, percentage of water bodies achieving good ecological status, and compliance of waters specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and nature conservation. Some of these data relating to protected sites are also included in \u2018D2 Extent and condition of protected sites \u2013 land, water and sea\u2019. All the Water theme indicators are linked, but 2 indicators that are important to consider as part of the wider state of the water environment are: \u2018B4 Condition of bathing waters\u2019 and \u2018B6 Natural functions of water and wetland ecosystems\u2019.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. A revised interim indicator is presented here as an Experimental Statistic. This expands on previous \nreporting to show data across the water environment. It includes metrics from the WFD Regulations status tests for (a) surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal \nwaters); (b) groundwaters; and (c) waters protected for a specific reason such as drinking waters and nature sites. For each water type, we include a representative element that is tested to assess the condition of a water body; reflecting water quality and/or hydromorphology. There are many more elements assessed and tests undertaken; this represents a snapshot of the complete WFD Regulations dataset. Supporting detail for each of the water types and a more detailed dashboard of data are available in the\n[Evidence Pack](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-water-environment-indicator-b3-supporting-evidence). These data are being published as an Experimental Statistic in order to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator. We would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk). Further work is required to develop the indicator which may, for example, show change over time. We will work with partners continue to develop our approach for future reporting. Source data are currently published [WFD element status](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4d28e5c2-dc05-4945-9574-002fa71db22f/wfd-cycle-2-overall-classification); [protected area data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/river-basin-management-plans-national-evidence-and-data-report); [State of the environment: water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment).\n\n## Trend description \n\n**a) For surface waters (including rivers, lakes, estuaries and coasts)**\n\n16% of surface water bodies met the \u201cone out all out\u201d criteria of the WFD Regulations in 2019. For rivers, invertebrates and the combined test for macrophytes and phytobenthos\n(plants and algae) are reported to indicate biological quality, where 76% and 45% of tests \ncarried out passed for the water bodies assessed respectively. For lakes, the \nrepresentative biological element shown is phytoplankton with 52% of water bodies \nassessed passing. Saltmarsh is shown for estuaries and coasts and reflects the extent of \nhabitat and show 36% and 50% of water bodies monitored, pass the test respectively.\n\n**b) Groundwaters**\n\n75% passing quantitative tests and 45% pass chemical (qualitative) tests. \n\n**c) Sites specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and \nnature conservation.**\n\n52% of surface water areas and 53% of groundwater drinking water protected areas are \nnot at risk of deterioration. For protected nature sites, 46% are at favourable condition and \n47% are in an unfavourable but recovering condition.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/290874d3396bae4b2df971046f1343f4cafd9e4c","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-14: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/f1bddc8321991a12cf5eb15b60de37b7a75c0c22","indicator":"2.3.1","target_id":"2.3","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-03-01","graph_title":"State of the water environment"}
