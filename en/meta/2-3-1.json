The indicator comprises several metrics including percentage of water tests meeting good (or better) status for ecology and chemistry, percentage of water bodies achieving good ecological status, and compliance of waters specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and nature conservation. \u2018Status\u2019 refers to quality as measured under the Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 (the WFD Regulations). Some of these data relating to protected sites are also included in indicator \u2018D2 Extent and condition of protected sites \u2013 land, water and sea\u2019. All the Water theme indicators are linked, but 2 indicators that are important to consider as part of the wider state of the water environment are \u2018B4 Condition of bathing waters\u2019 and \u2018B6 Natural functions of water and wetland ecosystems\u2019.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2022 in a finalised form. A revised interim indicator is presented here as an experimental statistic that was first presented in 2021. It includes metrics from the WFD Regulations status tests for (a) surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters) and (b) groundwaters; as well as additional metrics for (c) waters protected for a specific reason such as drinking waters and nature sites. For each water type, we include a representative element that is tested to assess the condition of a water body, reflecting water quality and/or hydromorphology (the physical character and water content in water bodies). There are many more elements assessed and tests undertaken; the data represent a snapshot of the complete WFD Regulations dataset. There are no new assessments included in the 2022 report.\n\nSupporting detail for each of the water types and a more detailed dashboard of data are available on the updated [B3 Evidence Pages](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-water-environment-indicator-b3-supporting-evidence). These data have been published as an experimental statistic to facilitate user involvement in the development of this indicator.\n\nWe would therefore welcome any feedback on these statistics, particularly on their usefulness and value, via [25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk](mailto:25YEPindicators@defra.gov.uk).\n\nFurther work is required to develop the indicator which may, for example, show change over time. We will continue to work with partners to develop our approach for future reporting. Data and evidence will begin to come from different sources as Environment Agency monitoring networks are updated as part of the Natural Capital Ecosystem Assessment development. Piloting and rollout of new networks has begun, and data will start to feed into indicator reporting from 2023. Existing source data are currently published ([WFD element status ,](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4d28e5c2-dc05-4945-9574-002fa71db22f/wfd-cycle-2-overall-classification) [protected area data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/river-basin-management-plans-national-evidence-and-data-report), [State of the environment and the water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment)).\n\n## Trend description for Figures B3a, B3b and B3c\n\n### B3a) Surface waters (including rivers, lakes, estuaries and coasts)\n\nIn total, 16% of surface water bodies met all the relevant criteria of the WFD Regulations in 2019. For rivers, invertebrates and the combined test for macrophytes and phytobenthos (plants and algae) are reported to indicate biological quality, where 76% and 45% of tests carried out passed for the water bodies assessed, respectively. For lakes, the representative biological element shown is phytoplankton with 52% of water bodies assessed passing. For estuaries and coasts saltmarsh is used to reflect the extent and quality of habitat; results show 36% and 50% of water bodies monitored pass the test, respectively.\n\n### B3b) Groundwaters\n\nIn 2019, 75% of groundwaters passed quantitative tests and 45% passed chemical (qualitative) tests.\n\n### B3c) Sites specially protected for specific uses such as drinking water abstraction and nature conservation\n\nIn 2019 to 2020, 52% of surface water and 53% of groundwater areas (sites) protected for drinking water abstraction were assessed as not being at risk of deterioration. For protected nature sites, 46% were in favourable condition and 47% were in an unfavourable but recovering condition in 2019.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nNo assessment of change was undertaken for this indicator as a suitable time series is not yet available in the Outcome Indicator Framework.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-01-13","national_data_updated_date":"2023-01-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-01-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/502dedeab89faeb5dda33813db8d7cbbb0d4e1cb","national_data_update_url_text":"2023-01-13: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/502dedeab89faeb5dda33813db8d7cbbb0d4e1cb","indicator":"2.3.1","target_id":"2.3","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-03-01","graph_title":"State of the water environment"}
