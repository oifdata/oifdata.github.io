Fish are a good indicator of healthy freshwater environments, responding to changes in water quality (including temperature) and quantity, as well as the quality of river habitats, necessary to sustain healthy juvenile populations and enable migration throughout the rivers to complete their life cycles. Fish also provide an important recreational and economic benefit from freshwaters.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 in a finalised form. An updated interim indicator is presented here that expands on previous reporting to show (a) the proportion of principal salmon rivers at risk in England and, additionally, (b) the classification of fish species within English rivers. B7a shows annually published [national salmon stock data](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/salmonid-and-freshwater-fisheries-statistics-2019). For this assessment, each river\u2019s salmon stocks are placed into one of 4 categories: at risk; probably at risk; probably not at risk; and not at risk. The results act as a proxy for whether a particular river is at risk or not. In addition, a second measure of freshwater health has been included for the first time in 2021. [Fish classification data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/4d28e5c2-dc05-4945-9574-002fa71db22f/wfd-cycle-2-overall-classification) for B7b reflect the status of fish species within rivers assessed in England. The results act as a proxy for whether the status of a particular river is: high; good; moderate; poor or bad. Further work will examine the coverage of the indicator.  \n\n## Trend description \n\n**a) Salmon stock status**\n\nThe percentage of principal salmon rivers at risk in England has risen by 10 percentage points, from 48% in 2004 to 58% in 2019; the percentage of rivers in the 'probably at risk' category has increased by 15 percentage points, from 21% to 36% over the same time period. The percentage of rivers in the 'not at risk' category has fallen by 24 percentage points to zero between 2004 and 2019, and while the percentage of rivers that are probably not at risk has fluctuated in the intervening years, it is the same in 2019 as it was in 2004. \n\n**b) Classification of fish**\n\nThe data show a slight but consistent increase in the numbers of rivers classed as high and good ecological status for fish between 2009 and 2015 and a corresponding small decrease in numbers of rivers in the poor and bad categories. Indications are that there was no change in the proportions of rivers in the 5 different categories between 2016 and 2019.\n\n\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-26: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/6f14a38f7f23d525c4e7acc2ee2f6632968a889f","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/482b2d9931f1ccee466a99f1def9175b047d6a6f","indicator":"2.7.1","target_id":"2.7","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-07-01","graph_title":"Health of freshwaters assessed through fish populations"}
