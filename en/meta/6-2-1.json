At the same time, the Environment Agency published the updated [National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management (FCERM) Strategy for England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england--2) and recently reported progress against this in the [National flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy for England action plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-flood-and-coastal-erosion-risk-management-strategy-for-england-action-plan). We have commissioned new research to inform the development of FCERM indicators for future reporting. As part of this work we are reviewing the F1 and F2 indicators for the 25 Year Environment Plan to ensure they align with the outcomes of the policy statement and national strategy.\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"6.2.1","target_id":"6.2","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-02-01","graph_title":"Communities resilient to flooding and coastal erosion"}
