The indicator will focus on open ocean (pelagic) habitats and populations of key species groups within the food web. These show whether ecosystems are healthy and are being used sustainably. Currently, the metrics within this indicator are being developed for the UK Marine Strategy Descriptors 1 (biodiversity), 4 (food webs) and 6 (seafloor integrity) and the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for reporting in 2021 as significant development is required. Research is underway to further develop the food web metrics that constitute this indicator. Analytical methods and some data on [food webs](https://moat.cefas.co.uk/biodiversity-food-webs-and-marine-protected-areas/food-webs/) are available.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","indicator":"3.8.1","target_id":"3.8","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-08-01","graph_title":"Healthy seas: marine food webs functioning"}
