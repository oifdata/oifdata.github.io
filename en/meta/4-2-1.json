These include our Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Ramsar sites. These area designations have been included as they focus on the protection of biodiversity and provide legal mechanisms for this protection. This indicator currently has 2 components: (a) extent of protected sites on land, freshwater and at sea and (b) condition of terrestrial SSSIs on land and water. Condition for terrestrial sites is assessed against relevant common standards agreed by the UK conservation agencies. Condition methodology for marine sites is currently under development.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nThis indicator is not available for publishing in 2022 in a finalised form. An interim indicator is presented here that shows the condition of SSSIs (D2b) in England. Data for this interim indicator are published annually as [England Biodiversity Indicator 1 \u2013 Extent and condition of protected areas](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/england-biodiversity-indicators). Work is underway to review reporting for terrestrial and freshwater sites. Further work is required to implement a methodology for assessing the condition of marine sites.\n\n## Note on Figures D2b\n\nThe figures presented in this indicator differ from the England element of the [UK Biodiversity Indicator C1 \u2013 Protected Areas](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/ukbi-c1-protected-areas/), which includes additional area designations (Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks) that are not included here.\n\n## Trend description for Figures D2a and D2b\n\n### D2a) Extent of Protected sites\n\nNatural England and Defra have identified a methodological issue with the protected sites data contained in the England Biodiversity Indicator 1, which may have resulted in some overestimation. It is unlikely to have affected the overall trend. We are working together to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\n\n### D2b) Condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest\n\nThere has been a net decrease in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition; down from 44% in 2003 to 38.4% in 2021. The sudden drop in the area of SSSIs in favourable condition from 43.2% in 2010 to 36.6% in 2011 was largely due to a more rigorous application of the \u2018Common Standard for Monitoring\u2019 protocols in assessing unit condition. While there has been a small increase in the area in favourable condition over the last 10 years (from 36.6% in 2011 to 38.4% in 2021), the figure has fallen slightly in the latest year. The area of SSSIs in unfavourable recovering condition has increased substantially from 13% in 2003 to 53% in 2021.\n\n## Assessment of change\n\nLittle or no change was observed for the extent of protected sites on land and water in England over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2016 to 2021), or the medium term. An increase (or improvement) was observed over the long-term time period. The has been an increase in the extent of protected sites at sea in England over the short, medium and long term. This assessment does not consider whether any improvements seen are on a sufficient scale for meeting targets.\n\nThere has been little or no change in the percentage of SSSIs in England achieving favourable condition over the most recent 5 years for which trends can be assessed (2016 to 2021). An increase (or improvement) was observed over the medium term, while there has been a long-term decrease (deterioration).\n\nFurther information on this assessment, along with details on the methodology, is provided in the [Assessment background](/assessment/background) page. Summaries by 25 Year Environment Plan goal and information on indicator links are presented in the [Assessment results](/assessment/results/) pages.\n\n\n### Table D2b: Assessment of change in the condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in England (in favourable condition)\n\n| Period | Date range | Percent change | Assessment of change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Short term | 2016-2021 | -0.5 (unsmoothed) | Little or no change |\n| Medium term | 2011-2021 | +4.9 (unsmoothed) | Improvement |\n| Long term | 2003-2021 | -12.8 (unsmoothed) | Deterioration |\n\nPercent change in D2b refers to the difference seen between the first and last years in the specified date range.\n","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-03-06","national_data_updated_date":"2023-03-06","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2023-03-06: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/083aeb3ed3d9be503b4785a5800150083cb472d5","national_data_update_url_text":"2023-03-06: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/083aeb3ed3d9be503b4785a5800150083cb472d5","indicator":"4.2.1","target_id":"4.2","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-02-01","graph_title":"Extent and condition of protected sites \u2013 land, water and sea"}
