Heritage features enable us to understand how our landscapes have been formed and are an important aspect of landscape character that significantly contribute to our enjoyment and appreciation of the natural beauty. We have a particular responsibility to conserve heritage features of designated sites. The indicator uses information from SSSI condition assessments and information which supports the production of the annual Heritage at Risk Register.\n\nAll geological (including geomorphological) features designated as SSSIs have first been subject to rigorous and systematic scientific assessment leading to their selection as nationally important Geological Conservation Review (GCR) sites. There are currently 1,150 SSSIs in England designated wholly, or in part, for their geology, encompassing 1,673 features identified through the GCR. Many SSSIs contain more than one geological heritage feature.\n\nMonuments designated as Scheduled Monuments have been recognised by the Secretary of State as being nationally important. For a monument to be considered of national importance its surviving features, above and/or below the surface of the land or sea bed, must have a particular significance that relates to its historic, traditional, architectural, artistic and/or archaeological interest. There are currently 19,848 Scheduled Monuments in England.\n\n## Readiness and links to data\n\nData are available on [SSSI condition assessments](https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteSearch.aspx) (as a searchable database), and also as data download of SSSI Monitored features. Data on [Scheduled Monuments at risk](https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage-at-risk/) are also available. These data have been collated over an extended time period. It is not currently possible to update them in full on a regular basis. A programme of work aimed at assessing the condition of as yet unassessed geological features and reassessing the condition of features which have not been assessed for more than 6 years, was initiated in 2020 and updated data will be reported on in 2022.\n\n## Trend description\n\n**a) Condition of geological and geomorphological heritage features of Sites of Special Scientific Interest**\n\nIn total, 60% of all designated geological features have been assessed as in favourable condition. A further 8% have been assessed as unfavourable but recovering. Approximately 1% have been destroyed or partially destroyed.\n\n**b) Condition of Scheduled Monuments**\n\nIn total, 85% of all Scheduled Monuments are considered as being in optimal or generally satisfactory condition, whereas 13% are considered as either being in a generally unsatisfactory condition or having extensive significant problems.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fa79abbaa01cb7d66c8e0783b4f27de36fa4e9f8","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-07-23: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/fd6c7604c4881b77fb38fd8c504be1e74f0fa328","indicator":"7.2.1","target_id":"7.2","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-02-01","graph_title":"Condition of heritage features including designated geological sites and scheduled monuments"}
