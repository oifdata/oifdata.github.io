It shows the percentage of designated bathing waters meeting conditions sufficient to minimise the risk of harm to bathers from faecal pollution. It is based on a set of microbiological tests (measuring E.coli and intestinal enterococci) performed on waters used for bathing. The bacteria, if present, can cause severe stomach upsets and gastro-intestinal illness. Bathing waters are mainly coastal beaches but also include a number of inland freshwater lakes and an area on a river.\n\n## Readiness and links to data \n\nData on [Bathing water quality statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/bathing-water-quality-statistics) are already published annually; longer-term trends are available in the [State of the environment: water quality report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/state-of-the-environment). Due to the impact of COVID-19 there are no new data reported in 2021.\n\n## Note\n\nAs reported by the [Official statistics announcement for Bathing Water quality statistics England (2020)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/announcements/bathing-water-quality-statistics-england-2020?cachebust=1608047938) an official statistic has not been produced for 2020 and this indicator cannot be updated. This is due to the severe impacts on bathing water monitoring and analysis caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the necessary adherence with government guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n## Trend description \n\nThe number of designated bathing waters in England meeting at least the minimum standard (sufficient, good or excellent) has increased considerably from 45.7% in 1995 to 98.3% in 2019; it has remained relatively stable over the last 4 years at between 97.8% and 98.5%. The number of bathing waters achieving excellent status has also increased considerably since 1995, with 71.4% meeting this standard in 2019. The number of bathing waters rated as poor has remained below 3% since 2015.\n\n","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/a7464753b18a6dadc2b7396ef4ef4d64a9e289b0","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-04-19: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/OIF-Dashboard/commit/2fe79b335ca81eb1b24b88b151c41cb44e6c8d76","indicator":"2.4.1","target_id":"2.4","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-04-01"}
